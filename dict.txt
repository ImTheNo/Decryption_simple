Jack and Jill 

~cPROLOGUE 

THE GAMES BEGIN 

SAM HARRISON swung his agile body out of the silver blue Ford Aerostar, which he 
had parked on Q Street in the Georgetown section of Washington. Horror stories and 
games are popular for a good reason, he was thinking as he locked the vehicle and set its 
alarm. Not the comfortable sit-around-the-campfire horror tales and games we used to 
cherish as kids, but the real-life horror stories that are around us everywhere these days. 

Now I'm living one myself. I'm about to become part of the horror. 

How easy it is. How terribly, terribly easy to move past the edge and into the darkness. 

He had stalked and shadowed Daniel Fitzpatrick for two long weeks. He'd done his job 
in New York City, London, Boston, and finally, here in Washington, D.C. Tonight he 
was going to murder the United States senator. In cold blood, execution-style. No one 
would be able to figure out why. No one would have a clue that might matter later on. 

That was the first and most important rule of the game called Jack and Jill. 

In many ways this was a textbook celebrity-stalker pattern. 

He knew it to be true as he took up his post across from 211 Q Street. 

And yet, if anyone bothered to look more closely, it was like no other stalking pattern 
before. What he was going to do now was more provocative than secretly observing 
Senator Fitzpatrick down obscene numbers of Gleniivet cocktails at The Monocle, his 
favorite bar in Washington. This was the truest form of madness, Sam Harrison knew. It 
was pure madness. He didn't believe he was mad. He believed only in the validity of the 
game of chance. 

And then, less than thirty yards across the shiny-wet street -- there was Daniel Fitzpatrick 
himself. Right on schedule. 

At least, close enough. 

He watched the senator stiffly climb out of a gleaming, navy blue Jaguar coupe, a 1996 
model. He wore a gray topcoat with a paisley silk scarf. A sleek, slender woman in a 
black dress was with him. A Burberrys raincoat was casually thrown over her arm. She 
was laughing at something Fitzpatrick had said. She threw her head back like a beautiful, 
spirited horse. A wisp of her warm breath met the cool of the night. 


The woman was at least twenty years the senator's junior. She wasn't his wife, Sam 
knew. Dannyboy Fitzpatrick rarely if ever slept with his wife. The blond woman walked 
with a slight limp, which made the two of them even more intriguing. Memorable, 
actually Sam Harrison concentrated fiercely Measure twice, measure five times, if 
necessary. He took stock of all the details one final time. He had arrived in Georgetown 
at eleven-fifteen. He looked as if he belonged in the chic, attractive, fashionable 
neighborhood around Q Street. He looked exactly right for the part he was going to play 
Avery big part in a very big story, one of the biggest in America's history. Or some 
would say American theater. 

A leading-man role, to be sure. 

He wore professorial, tortoiseshell glasses for the part. He never wore glasses. Didn't 
need them. 

His hair was light blond. His hair wasn't really blond. 

He called himself Sam Harrison. His name wasn't really Sam. 

Or Harrison. 

For that night's special occasion, he'd carefully selected a soft black cashmere turtleneck, 
charcoal gray trousers, which were pleated and cuffed, and light-brown walking boots. 
He wasn't really such a dapper, self-absorbed dresser. His thick hair was cut short, 
vaguely reminiscent of the actor Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard, one of his least-
favorite movies. He carried a small black duffel bag, swinging it like a baton as he now 
walked briskly toward 211. A camcorder was tucked inside the bag. 

He planned to capture as much of this as possible on film. 

This was history in the making. It really was history: America at the end of its century, 
America at the end of an era, America at the end. 

At quarter to twelve, he entered 211 through a darkened service entranceway that smelled 
strongly of ammonia and of dust and decay He walked up to the fourth floor, where the 
senator had his flat, his study, his love nest in the capital. 

He reached Daniel Fitzpatrick's door, 4J, at ten minutes to twelve. He was still pretty 
much on time. So far, so good. Everything was going exactly as planned. 

The highly polished mahogany door opened right in his face. 

He stared at an ash-blond woman who was slender and trim and well kept. She was 
actually somewhat plainer looking than she had appeared from a distance. It was the 
same woman who had gotten out of the blue Jag with Fitzpatrick. The woman with the 
limp. 


Except for a gold barrette in her hair, a lioness from a trip to the Museum of Modern Art 
in New York, and a gold choker, she was gloriously naked. 

"Jack," she whispered. 

"Jill," he said, and smiled. 

IN A DIFFERENT PARTof Washington, in a different world, another would-be killer 
was playing an equally terrifying game. He had found an absolutely terrific hiding place 
among the thick pines and a few towering, elderly oaks at the center of Garfield Park. He 
made himself comfortable inside a kind of tent formed by the overhanging tree limbs and 
a few sturdy, overgrown shrubs. 

"Let's get busy," he whispered, though no one was in the hiding place with him. This was 
going to be a wonderful adventure, a great fantasy. He believed it with his whole heart, 
body, and what remained of his soul. 

He sat cross-legged on the damp grass and began to work on his face and hair. A tune 
from the rock band Hole was blasting from the speakers inside his head. This was really 
good stuff. He loved it to death. Disguises and costumes were a rush. They were about 
the only thing that let you truly escape, and goddamn, did he ever need to escape. 

When he eventually finished with the costume, he emerged from the shadows of the trees. 
He had to laugh. He was cracking himself up today This was the best yet. It was so 
goofy that it was great. Reminded him of a good joke: Roses are red/violets are blue/I'm 
schizophrenic/ad so am I. 

Hardy-hat! 

He definitely looked like an old, homeless fuck-bum now. He really did look like a 
hopeless old fart. Like the mangy character in the rock song "Aqualung." He had put on 
a white fright wig and a salt-and-pepper beard from an actor's costume kit. Any slight 
failure of his imagination, or skill as a makeup artist, was covered by the floppy hood of 
his sweatshirt. 

The sweatshirt had }tAPPY, ?IAPPY. JOY, JOY printed on it. 

What an incredible, mindblowing adventure this was going to be, he kept thinking. 
Happy, happy. Joy, joy. That was the ticket. That said it all. The irony just killed him. 

The killer-to-be crossed the park, walking quickly now, almost breaking into a run. He 
was headed in the general direction of the Anacostia River. 

He began to see people. Strollers, muggers, lovers, whatever the hell they were. Most of 
them were black, but that was okay. 


That was good, actually. Nobody gave a damn about the blacks in D.C. That was a fact 
of life. 

"Aqualung, oh-oh-oh, Aqualung," he sang the old rock-and-roll-tune as he walked. It 
was from a really great old band called Jethro Tull. He listened to rock music 
incessantly, even in his sleep. Earphones on all the time. He had just about memorized 
the entire history of rock and roll. If he could just force himself to listen to Hootie and 
the Blowfish, he'd have it all down cold. 

Hardy-har, he laughed at his Hootie joke. He was in a really fine mood today. This was 
such a cool, fucked-up, freaky blast of a head trip. It was the best of times, it was the 
worst of times. 

Best and worst, worst and best, worst and worse? 

He had already selected the spot for the murder. The thicket of spruce trees and 
evergreens up close to the Southeast Freeway It was wild and overgrown and nearly 
perfect. 

The spot was at a ninety-degree angle to a grouping of delapo, yellow-brick row houses 
and a popular bodega on Sixth Street in Southeast. He had already scouted there, scoped 
the area out, fallen in love with his spot. He could already see kids from the Sojourner 
Truth Elementary School traipsing in and out of the corner candy store. The little 
buggers were so cute at that age. 

Man, I hate cute with a passion you wouldn't believe. Little fucking robots was what 
they really were. Mean little parasites, too. Kidz! Everything about them was so kute. 

He scrunched down and climbed under the thick, scratchy bushes and got down to serious 
business. He began to blow up several latex balloons -- red, orange, blue, yellow ones. 

These were big, really colorful suckers that no kids in their wrong mind could resist. 
Personally, he had always hated balloons intensely Hated the forced, phony gaiety they 
seemed to symbolize. But most kids were ya-ya about balloons. Figured, right? 

He tied about a ten-foot length of twine around one balloon. 

Then he secured the string to a thick tree branch. 

The balloon floated lazily above the old tree. It looked like a pretty, decapitated head. 

He waited in his tree hut. He hung out with himself, which he liked to do anyway 

"Got to waste some-body to-day," he hummed a little non-song to a non-melody "Got to, 
got to. Just gotta, gotta, gotta," he sang and kind of liked the riff. 


He heard something move near his hiding place. Something cracked. A branch or 


something? Somebody come to visit? 
He listened closely. Tree branches were definitely being moved, stepped on, broken. 
Everything sounded amplified -- like SNAPPP! 


His mind had slipped away and the noise startled the hell out of him, if anybody really 
wanted to know the truth. His adrenaline was kicking in like crazy He almost swallowed 
his Adam's apple. 

Suddenly, the top half of a face appeared, came into his view. 
Just the forehead and the whites of someone's eyes. 
THE WHITES OF HER EYES! 
Peeking through the tree branches at him. 
He saw the face of a tiny black girl. Five or six years old, really cute. She saw him, too. 


Fair and square. 
I SEE YOU, HONEYPiE. YES, I DO. I SEE YOU! 
"Hi." He said it real nice and polite, which he could be when he wanted to. He smiled, 


and she almost smiled back. 


He spoke softly "You want a big balloon? I've got plenty of extra balloons, balloons-aplenty, 
balloons galore. Here's a cherry red balloon with your name on it." 
The little girl just stared at him. She didn't speak a syllable. 
Didn't move. She was afraid of him -- imagine that. Probably confused because he'd said 


her name was on one of the balloons. 


"Okay, no balloon then. Fine. Forget about the free balloon offer. No balloon for you, 
little girl. That's okey-dokey with me. 
No free balloon today! No sir!" 
"Yesssss, please," she suddenly said. Her brown eyes widened like blossoming flowers. 


Beautiful little girl, right? Beautiful, chestnut brown eyes. 
"Stop being so shy, girl. Come over here, I'll give you a big, beautiful balloon. Let's see, 
I've got stop-sign red, sky blue, Popsicle orange, mellow yellow. Every color in the 
rainbow and then some." 



He mimicked somebody maybe it was that nutcase Kevin Bacon in The River Wild, 
which he'd rented a week or so back. 

Two weeks back? Who knew? Who cared! As he was speaking, his hand tightened on 
the handle of a miniature baseball bat, which was reinforced with electrical tape. The bat 
was eighteen and a half inches long, the kind the local gangbangers used to keep law and 
order in the projects. 

He continued to speak to the little girl in a happy singsong that was actually sarcastic and 
ironic as hell. 

"Red one," the girl finally chirped. Of course. She had a red ribbon in her hair. Red is 
the color of my true love's love. 

She lightly, very tentatively, stepped out into the clearing. He noticed her feet were so 
tiny. Like a size minus three. She reached toward the colorful balloons clutched tightly 
in his outstretched hand. She didn't seem to notice that his hand was shaking badly. 

Behind his back, he gripped the short, powerful ballbat. Then he swung -- real hard. 

Happy, happy. Joy, joy. 

COULD THEYactually get away with murder -- especially a high-level, provocative 
murder like this? Jack was confident they could. It was easier than anyone knew to kill 
another human being, or several of them, and never get caught, never even be suspected. 
It happened all the time. 

Jill was scared and visibly tense, though. He couldn't blame her. In "real life," she was a 
Washington careerist, well-bred, bright, certainly not the typical murderous kook you 
read about. 

Not a very likely Jill, and therefore perfect for her part in the game of games. Almost as 
perfect as he was for his. 

"He's drunk, completely out," she whispered as they stood in the dark foyer of the 
apartment. "It helps that he's such an absolutely repellent snake." 

"You know what they say about our Dannyboy He's a very bad senator, but a much worse 
date." 

A hint of a smile -- a nervous smile -- from her. "Bad joke, but I can vouch for that. 
Let's go. Jack." 

Jill turned on her bare heels, and he followed close behind. 


He watched the slight hitch in her step. Bewitching in its way He watched her slender 
figure retreat through a tiny sitting room that was dimly lit by the hallway lamp. This 
was the way to the flat's bedroom, he knew. 

They walked silently through a small living room. An American flag proudly stood 
beside the stone fireplace. The sight of the flag turned his stomach. Color photographs 
on the wall of a sailing regatta.somewhere, probably Cape Cod. 

"Izzit you, my dear?" a gruff, whiskey-soaked voice thundered from behind the living 
room walls. 

"Who else could it be?" Jill answered. 

Jack and Jill entered the bedroom together. "Surprise party," Jack announced. He had a 
Beretta semiautomatic out. It was aimed at the senator's head. 

His gun hand was steady, his head very clear now. History' in the making. No chance to 
go back now. 

Daniel Fitzpatrick bolted up in his bed, surprised and burning mad. "What the bloody 
hell? What the... who the frig are you? How the shit did you get in here?" he slurred his 
words. His face and neck were bright red. 

Jack couldn't help it -- he smiled in spite of everything that was going on. The senator 
looked like a beached whale, or perhaps an aging walrus, in his fancy bed. 

"I guess you could say I'm your despicable past, finally catching up to you, Senator," he 
said. "Now shut up. Please. Let's make this as easy as we possibly can." 

He stared at Daniel Fitzpatrick and was reminded of something he'd read somewhere 
recently Upon seeing the senator at a speaking engagement, a spectator had remarked, 
"My God, hek an old man now." Indeed he was. Fitzpatrick was a white-haired, jowly, 
graceless, sprawlingly fat, old white man. 

He was also the enemy Jack opened the black duffel bag and handed Jill a pair of 
handcuffs. "One hand to each bedpost. Please and thank you." 

"It will be my pleasure," she said. There was a simple elegance in the way she spoke, 
acted, even the way she moved. 

"You're in on this?" Fitzpatrick gasped as he looked around at the blond woman he'd 
picked up at the bar in La Colline. He seemed to be actually seeing her for the first time. 

Jill smiled. "No, no. I was attracted by your vast, bloated belly, your alcoholic breath." 


Jack took out the camcorder and handed it over to Jill. She immediately aimed it at 


Senator Fitzpatrick, focused, and started to film. She was good with the camera. 
"What in God's name are you doing?" Fitzpatrick asked. His washed-out blue eyes were 
wide with astonishment, and then with genuine fear. "What the hell do you want? What's 
going on here? Dammit, I'm a United States senator." 


Jill began with the shocked and surprised and hurt look on the senator's face. She pulled 
out to a wider shot. Oops, a little too wide. Grabbed focus again. 


Jack smiled at the inappropriate outburst of bravado. How very Fitzpatrick. 
Then, voili! It was as if the whiskey-dullness swirling in his brain suddenly stopped. 
Daniel Fitzpatrick finally understood. 


"I don't want to die," he whispered. 
Tears unexpectedly rolled from his eyes. It was strangely affecting. 
"Please don't do this. You don't have to hurt me," he said. 
"It doesn't have to be like this. Please, I beg you. Listen to me. 
Will you just listen to what I have to say?" 
This was incredibly important footage, Jill knew. Academy Award stuff. Perhaps the 


documentary film of the century. They needed this for the game of games, for one of the 


surprises later on. 
Jack walked brislly across the bedroom. He placed the Beretta inches from the senator's 
forehead. 


This was it. This was where the exquisite game truly began. 


Rule two: This is history. What you're doing is important. Never forget that for a single 
moment. 
"I'm going to kill you, Senator Fitzpatrick. There's nothing for us to talk about. There's 


no way out of this. You were a Roman Catholic, so if you believe in God, say a prayer. 


Please say one for me, too. Say a prayer for Jack and Jill." 
This was gut-check time. He noticed that his hand was shaking a little now. Jill saw it, 
too. 


He told himself, This is an execution, and it well deserved And this is most definitely a 
horror story that I'm in. 


He fired once, from a distance of no more than a few inches. 
Daniel Fitzpatrick's head exploded. He fired a second time. 
Measure twice; cut twice as well. 
History was made. 
The game of games had begun. 
PART 1 
TOMORROW AGAIN 
OH NO, it's tomorrow again. 
It seemed as if I had no sooner fallen asleep than I heard banging in the house. It was 


loud, as disturbing as a car alarm. 
Persistent. Trouble too close to home? 
"Shit. Dammit," I whispered into the soft, deep folds of my pillow. "Leave me alone. 


Let me sleep through the night like a normal person. Go away from here." 
I reached for the lamp and knocked over a couple of books on the table. The Generalk 


Daughter and My American Journey and Snow Falling on Cedars. The mishap jolted me 
fully awake. 
I grabbed my service revolver from a drawer and hurried downstairs, passing the kids' 


room on the way. I heard, or thought that I could hear, the sound of their soft breathing 
inside. I had been reading them Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit the night 
before. Don't go into Mr. McGregork garden: Your father had an accident there; he was 
put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. 

I clutched the Glock even more tightly in my right hand. The banging stopped. Then 
started up again. Downstairs. 

I glanced at my wristwatch. It was three-thirty in the morning. 
Jesus, mercy The witching hour again. The hour I often woke up without any help from 
outside forces, from things that go BANG, BANG, BANG in the middle of the night. 


I continued down the steep, treacherous stairs. Cautious, suspicious. 
Suddenly, it was quiet all around me. 


I made no sound myself. My skin felt electrified in the darkness. 

This was not the recommended way to start the day, or even the middle of The night. 
Don't go into Mr. McGregor garden: Your father had an accident.... 

I continued into the kitchen -- my gun drawn -- where I suddenly saw the source of the 
banging. The day's first mystery was solved. 

My friend and partner was lurking at the back door like some high-octane version of a 
neighborhood hugger-mugger. 

John Sampson was the noisemaker; he was the trouble in my life; the day's first 
disturbance, anyway. All six foot nine, two hundred forty pounds of him. Two-John as 
he's sometimes called. 

Man Mountain. 

"There's been a murder," he said as I unlocked, unchained, and opened up for him. "This 
one is a honey, Alex." 

"OH, JESUS, JOHN. You know what time it is? You have any concept of time? Please 
get the hell away from my house. Go home to your own house. Bang on your own door 
in the middle of the night." 

I groaned and slowly shook my head back and forth, working nasty sleep-kinks out of my 
neck and shoulders. I wasn't quite awake yet. Maybe this was all a bad dream that I was 
having. 

Maybe Sampson wasn't on the back porch. Maybe I was still in bed with my pillow-
lover. And maybe not. 

"It can wait," I said. "Whatever the hell it is." 

"Oh, but it can't," he answered, shaking his head. "Believe me, Sugar, it can't." 

I heard a creaking noise behind me in the house. I swung around quickly, still a little 
spooked and jumpy My little girl was standing there in the kitchen. Jannie was in her 
electric-blue-butterfly pajamas, in her bare feet, with a frightened look on her face. The 
latest addition to our family, a beautiful Abyssinian cat named Rosie, trailedJannie by a 
step or two. Rosie had heard the noise downstairs, too. 

"What's the matter?"Jannie asked in a sleepy whisper, rubbing her eyes. "Why are you up 
so early? It's something bad, isn't it, Daddy?" 


"Go back to sleep, sweetheart," I told Jannie in the softest voice I could manage. "It's 
nothing," I had to lie to my little girl. 

My work had followed me home again. "We'll go upstairs now, so you can get your 
beauty sleep." 

I carried her up the stairs, softly nuzzling her cheek on the way, whispering sweet 
nonsense, dream talk. I tucked her in and checked on my son, Damon. Soon the two of 
them would be heading off to their respective schools -- Damon at Sojourner Truth, 
Jannie at Union Street. Rosie the cat continually crisscrossed between my legs as I 
performed my ministrations. 

Then I got dressed, and Sampson and I hurried to the early-morning crime scene in his 
car. We didn't have far to go. 

This one is a honey, Alex. 

Just four blocks from our house on Fifth Street. 

"I'm awake now, whether I like it or not, and I don't like it. Tell me about it," I said to 
Sampson as I watched the glittering red and blue lights of police cars and EMS trucks 
come into focus up ahead. 

Four blocks from our house. 

A lot of blue-and-whites were clustered at the end of a tunnel of leafless oak trees and 
red-brick project buildings. The disturbance appeared to be at my son Damon's school. 
(Jannie's school is a dozen blocks in the opposite direction.) My body tensed all over. 
There was a roaring, wintry shitstorm inside my head. 

"It's a little girl, Alex," Sampson said in an unusually soft voice for him. "Six years old. 
She was last seen at the Sojourner Truth School this afternoon." 

It was Damon's school. We both sighed. Sampson is almost as close to Damon and 
Jannie as I am. They feel the same way about him. 

A lot of people were already gathered outside the Federal-style two-story building that 
was the Sojourner Truth Elementary School. Half the neighborhood seemed to be up at 
four in the morning. I saw angry and shocked faces everywhere in the crowd. Some 
folks were in bathrobes, others wrapped in blankets. 

Their frosty breath poured out like car exhaust all over the school yard. The Washington 
Post had reported that more than five hundred children under the age of fourteen had died 
in D.C. 


during the past year alone. But the people here knew that. They didn't have to read it in 
the newspaper. 

A little six-year-old girl. Murdered at or near Damon school, the Truth School. I 
couldn't have imagined a worse nightmare to wake up to. 

"Sorry about this, Sugar," Sampson said as we climbed out of his car. "I figured you had 
to see this, though, to be here yourself." 

MY HEART was hammering and felt as if it were suddenly too big for my chest. My 
wife, Maria, had been shot down and killed not far from this place. Memories of the 
neighborhood, memories of a lifetime. I'll always love you, Maria. 

I saw a dented and rusting truck from the morgue in the school yard, and it was an 
unbelievably disturbing sight for me and everybody else. Rap music with a lot of bass 
was playing from somewhere on the edge of the bright police lights. 

Sampson and I pushed and angled our way through the frightened and uneasy crowd. 
Some wiseass muttered, "What's up, Chief?" and risked finding out. There was yellow 
crime-scene tape everywhere on the school grounds. 

At six three, I'm not as large as Man Mountain, but we are both big men. We make quite 
the pair when we arrive at a crime scene: Sampson with his huge shaved skull and black 
leather car Coat; me usually in a gray warm-up jacket from Georgetown. Shoulder 
holster under the coat. Dressed for the game that I play, a game called sudden death. 

"Dr. Cross is here," I heard a few low rumbles in the crowd. 

My name uttered in vain. I tried to ignore the voices as best I could. Block them out of 
my consciousness. Officially, I was a deputy chief of detectives, but I was mostly 
working as a street detective these days. It was the way I wanted it for now. The way it 
had to be. This was definitely an "interesting" time for me. I had seen enough homicide 
and violence for one lifetime. I was considering going into private practice as a shrink 
again. I was considering a lot of things. 

Sampson lightly touched my shoulder. He sensed this was bad for me. He saw it was 
maybe too close to the bone. "You okay, Alex?" 

"I'm fine," I lied for the second time that morning. 

"Sure you are, Sugar. You're always fine, even when you're not. You're the 
dragonslayer, right?" Sampson said and shook his head. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a young woman wearing a black sweatshirt with Alu. 
ALWAYS LOVE YOU, in white letters. 


Another dead child. Tysheika. People in the neighborhood sometimes wore the dark 
shirts to funerals of murdered kids. My grandmother, Nana Mama, had quite a collection 
of them. 

Something else caught my eye. A woman standing back from the crowd, under the 
spectral branches of a withering elm. She didn't seem to quite fit with the rest of the 
neighborhood group. 

She was tall and nice-looking. She wore a belted raincoat over ieans, and flat shoes. 
Behind her, I could see a blue sedan. A Mercedes. 

Shek the one. That's her. She the one for you. The crazy thought just came out of 
nowhere. Filled my head with sudden, inappropriate joy I made a mental note to find out 
who she was. 

I stopped to talk with a young, intense homicide detective wearing a red Kangol hat with 
a brown sport jacket and brown nitted tie. I was beginning to take control. 

"Bad way to start the day, Alex," Rakeem Powell said as I came up to him. "Or to end 
one, in my case." 

I nodded at Rakeem. "Can't imagine a worse way." I felt sick in the well of my stomach. 
"What do you know about this so far, Rakeem? Anything juicy for us to go on? I need to 
hear it all." 

The detective glanced at his small black notepad. He flipped a few pages. "kirtle girl's 
name is Shanelie reen. Popular girl. 

A sweetheart, from what I hear so far. She was in the first grade here at the Truth School. 
lives two blocks from school in the Northfield Village projects. Parents both work. They 
let her walk home by herself. Not too goddamn smart, but what can you do, you know? 
They came home tonight, Shanelie wasn't there. 

They reported her missing around eight. That's the parents over there." 

I glanced around. They were just a couple of kids themselves. 

kooked completely devastated and heartbroken. I knew they would never be the same 
after this horrifying night. Nobody could be. 

"Neither of them suspects?" I had to ask. 

Rakeera shook his head and said, "I don't think so, Alex. 

Shanelie was their life." 


"Please check them, Rakecm. Check both parents. How did she get here in the school 
yard?" I asked him. 

Powell sighed. "That's the first thing we don't know. Where she was killed is the second. 
Who did it is strike three for the Mod Squad." 

It was obvious from looking at Shanelie that she had been dumped here, probably 
murdered someplace else. We were right at the beginning of this terrible case. kots of 
work to do. My case now. 

"You know how she was killed?" I asked Rakeera. 

The homicide detective frowned. "Take a look for yourself. 

Tell me what you think." 

I didn't want to look, but I had to. I bent down close to Shanelie. I could smell the little 
girl's blood: copper, like a lot of pennies had been thrown on the ground. I couldn't help 
thinking of Damon andJannie, my own kids. I couldn't stop the overwhelming sadness I 
felt. It ate at me, like acid splashed all over my body I knelt on the cracked and broken 
concrete to examine the body of the six-year-old girl. Shanelie lay in a fetal position. All 
she had on was a pair of flowered pink-and-blue underpants. A red bow was impossibly 
tangled up in her braids, and she had tiny gold earrings in her ears. 

The rest of her clothes were missing. The killer had apparently taken the little girl's 
school clothes with him. 

She was such a little beauty, such a sweetheart, I could see. Even after what someone had 
done to her. I was looking at the how; the manner in which the six-year-old girl had been 
brutally murdered sometime earlier that night, her whole life silenced in an instant of 
madness and horror. 

I gently turned the girl's body a few inches. Her head lolled to one side, the neck 
probably broken. She weighed next to nothing. 

Just a baby The right side of her little face was partly gone. 

Obliterated was a better description. The murderer had struck Shanelie so many times, 
and so violently, that little on the right side of the face was recognizable. 

"How could he do this to such a beautiful little girl?" I muttered under my breath. "Poor 
Shanelie. Poor baby," I whispered to no one but myself. A tear formed in my eye. I 
blinked it away, There was no place for that here. 

One of Shanelle's eyes was missing. Her face is like a two-sided, two-faced mask. Two 
sides to a child? Two faces? What did that mean? 


There was another fiend on the loose in Washington. 

A child killer this time. 

A TALL, THIN MAN in a black raincoat and black floppy rain hat slowly, cautiously 
approached the door of Senator Daniel Fitzpatrick's apartment a little before six o'clock 
Tuesday morning. 

He examined the outer hallway for signs of a break-in, a struggle of some sort, but didn't 
find any He was thinking that he didn't want to be outside this apartment or anywhere 
near it. He wasn't sure what he expected to find inside, but he had the feeling it would be 
bad. Powerfully, overwhelmingly bad. This was so unreal. 

It was so odd for him to be here, a mystery inside a mystery. But here he was. 

The man noticed everything about the hallway Sprinkles of fallen plaster on the rug. 
Eight other doorways in sight. He had once been reasonably good at this routine. Being 
an investigator was like riding a bicycle, right? Sure it was. 

He jimmied open the door to 4J with a square of plastic very much like a credit card, only 
thinner, slicker to the touch. He guessed that breaking and entering was like riding a 
bike, too. 

You never forgot how. 

"I'm inside 4J," he spoke softly into a compact hand radio. 

Sweat had begun to form all over his body. His legs quivered slightly He was disgusted 
and he was afraid and he was definitely someplace that he shouldn't be. Unrealville, he 
called it in his mind. 

He quickly walked through the foyer and into the small living room with photos of 
Senator Fitzpatrick on every wall. Still no sign of a break-in or any trouble. 

"This could be a very nasty hoax," he reported into the radio. "I hope that's what it is." 
He paused. "Uh-oh. We have a problem." 

Everything had happened in the bedroom, and whoever had done everything had left a 
terrible mess. It was worse than anything he could have imagined it might be. 

"This is real bad. Senator Fitzpatrick is dead. Daniel Fitzpatrick has been murdered. 
This is not a hoax. The body appears to be fully rigorous. Flesh has a waxy tone. 
There's a lot of blood. Jesus, there's a lot of blood." 


He bent over the senator's corpse. He could smell cordite, almost taste it on his tongue. 
Most likely from the gun that killed Fitzpatrick. Unfortunately, there was much more to 
the brutal murder scene. Too much for him to handle. He fought to keep his cool. 
Riding a bike, right? 

"Two shots to the head. Close-in. Execution-style," he said into the handset. "Entry 
wounds about an inch apart." 

He sighed heavily Waited a moment, then began again. They didn't need to know 
everything he was seeing and feeling right now. 

"The senator is handcuffed to his bedposts. Look like police cuffs to me. His body is 
nude and not a pretty sight. Penis and scrotum appear to have been gouged out of the 
body There's a lot of blood all over the bed, a humongous stain. Big stain on the rug, too, 
where it soaked through." 

He forced his face even closer to the senator's silver-haired chest. He didn't like it, being 
this close to a dead man- or any man, for that matter. Fitzpatrick was wearing some kind 
of religious medal. Probably real silver. He smelled of a woman's perfume. The tall 
man, the investigator, was almost certain of it. "The D.C. police are going to be guessing 
jealous lover. 

Some kind of crime of high passion," he said. "Wait -- there's something else here. Okay 
Hold on. I've got to check this out." 

He didn't know how he'd missed it at first, but he sure as hell saw the note now. It was 
right next to the cordless telephone on the bed stand. Impossible to miss, right? But he'd 
missed it. He picked it up in his gloved hand. 

The note was typewritten on thick, expensive bond. He read it quickly Then he read it 
again, just to be sure... that the note was for real. 

Ah Dannyboy, we knew ya all too well One useless, thieving, rich bastard down So many 
more to go. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill To hose down all the slime Most imperiled Was poor 
Fitzpatrick Right schmuck, wrong place, wrong time. 

Truly, He read the note over the hand phone. He took one more look around, then left the 
senator's apartment as it was: in a state of bedlam and horror and death. When he was 
safely down on Q Street, he called in the homicide to the Washington police. 

He made the call anonymously No one could know that he'd been inside the senator's 
apartment, or especially, how it came to happen, and who he was. If anybody found out, 
all hell would really break loose -- as if it hadn't started already Everything was unreal, 
and it promised to get much worse. 


Jack and Jill had promised it. 

One useless, thieving, rich bastard down So many more to go. 

AT EVERY HUMAN TRAGEDY like this one, there is always someone who points. A 
man stood outside the crime-scene tape and pointed at the murdered child and also at me. 
I was remembering Jannie's prophetic words to me earlier that morning: It's something 
bad, isn't it, Daddy? 

Yes, it was. The baddest of the bad. The murder scene at the Sojourner Truth School 
was heartbreaking to me and, I was sure, to everyone else. The school yard was the 
saddest, most desolate place in the world. 

The chatter of portable police radios violated the air and made it hard to breathe. I could 
still smell the little girl's blood. It was thick in my nostrils and my throat, but mostly 
inside my head. 

Shanelle Green's parents were weeping nearby, but so were other people from the 
neighborhood, even complete strangers to the little girl. In most cities, in most civilized 
countries, a child murdered so young would be a catastrophe, but not in Washington, 
where hundreds of children die violent deaths every single year. 

"I want as large a street canvass as we can manage on this one," I told Rakeem Powell. 
"Sampson and I will be part of the canvass ourselves." 

"I hear you. We're on it in a big way. Sleep is overrated, anyway" 

"Let's go John. We've got to move on this now," I finally said to Sampson. 

He didn't argue or object. A murder like this is usually solved in the first twenty-four 
hours, or it isn't solved. We both knew that. 

From 6:00 A.M. on, Sampson and I canvassed the neighborhood with the other 
detectives and patrolmen that cold, miserable morning. We had to do it our way, house 
by house, street by street, mostly on foot. We needed to be involved in this case, to do 
something, to solve the heinous murder quickly, About ten in the morning, we heard 
about another shocking homicide in Washington. Senator Daniel Fitzpatrick had been 
murdered the night before. It had been a real bad night, hadn't it? 

"Not our job," Sampson said with cold, flat eyes. "Not our problem. Somebody else's." 

I didn't disagree. 

No one Sampson or I spoke to that morning had seen anything out of the ordinary around 
the Sojourner Truth School. We heard the usual complaints about the drug pushers, the 


zombielike crackheads, the prossies who work on Eighth Street, the growing number of 
gangbangers. 

But nothing out of the usual. 

"People loved that little sweetheart Shanelie," the ageless Hispanic lady who seemed to 
have run the corner grocery near the school forever told Sampson and me. "She always 
buy her Gummi Bears. She have such a pretty smile, you know?" 

No, I had never seen Shanelle Green smile, but I found that I could almost picture it. I 
also had a fixed image of the battered right side of the little girl's face. I carried it around 
like a bizarre wallet photo inside my head. 

Uncle Jimmie Kee, a successful and influential KoreanAmerican who owned several 
neighborhood businesses, was glad to talk with us. Jimmie is a good friend of ours. 
Occasionally, he comes along with us to a Redskins or Bullets game. 

He supplied a name that we already had on our shortlist of suspects. 

"What about this bad actor, Chop-It-Off-Chucky?" Uncle Jimmie volunteered as we 
spoke in the back of Ho-Woo-Jung, his popular restaurant on Eighth Street. I read the 
sign behind Jimmie: IMMIGRATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY. 

"Nobody catch that motherfucker yet. He kill other children before. He the worst man in 
Washington, D.C. Next to the president," Jimmie said and chuckled wickedly, "No 
bodies, though. No proof of it," Sampson said to Jimmie. 

"We don't even know if there really is a Chucky." 

That was true enough. For years there had been rumors about a horrifying child molester 
who worked the Northfield Village neighborhood, but there was nothing concrete. 
Nothing had ever been proved. 

"Chucky real," UncleJimmie insisted. His dark eyes narrowed to even thinner slits. 
"Chucky real as the devil. I see Chop-it-Off-Chucky in my dreams sometimes, Alex. So 
do the children who live around here." 

"You ever hear anything more specific about Chucky? Where he's been seen? Who saw 
him?" I asked. "Help us out if you can, Jimmie." 

"Oh, I gladly do that." He nodded his head and bunched his thick brown lips, his triple 
chin, his bulging throat. Jimmie habitually wore a chocolate brown suit with a tan fedora 
that bobbed as he spoke. "You meditating yet, Alex, getting in touch with chi energy?" 
he asked me. 


"I'm thinking about it, thinking about my chi Jimmie. Maybe my chi is running a little 
low right now. Tell us about Chucky." 

"I know lots bad stories about Chop-It-Off-Chucky. Scare kids all the time. Even the 
gangbangers scared of him. Young mothers, grandmothers, put up handbills in 
playgrounds. In my stores, too. Sad stories of missing children. I always permit it, 
Detectives. 

Man who harms children is the worst. You agree, Alex? You see it differently?" 

"No. I agree with you. That's why Sampson and I are out here today." 

I knew a lot about the child molester who had been nicknamed Chop-It-Off-Chucky. The 
unsubstantiated rumor was that he sliced off the genitalia of young kids who lived in the 
projects. Little boys and girls. No gender preference. Whether or not it was true, it 
seemed undeniable that someone had molested several children from the Northfield and 
Southv'ew Terrace projects, not far from here. Other children had simply disappeared. 

The police in the area didn't have the resources to create an effective crisis team to find 
Chucky, if Chucky existed. I had gone to the wall about it several times with the chief of 
detectives, but nothing had happened. Extra detectives never seemed available for duty 
in Southeast. The unfairness of the situation put me in a rage, made me as crazy as 
anything I can think of. 

"Sounds like another Mission: Impossible," Sampson said as we walked up G Street, in 
the general direction of the Marine barracks. "We're on our own. We're supposed to 
catch a chimera." 

"Nice image," I said, and had to smile at Man Mountain, his wild imagination, his mind. 

"Thought you'd like it, man of culture and refinement that you are." 

We were sipping steaming herb tea from Jimmie's restaurant. 

Patrolling the street. We looked like detectives, with our collars up and all. Big bad 
detectives. I wanted people to see us out working the neighborhood. 

"No real leads, no clues, no support," I said, agreeing with Sampson's judgment of the 
current state of affairs. "We take the assignment, anyway?" 

"We always do," he said. His eyes were suddenly hard and dull and almost scary to me. 
"Watch out, Chucky, watch your back. We're right on your sorry mythical ass." 

"Your chimera ass." 

"Exactly so, Sugar. Exactly so." 


IT WAS REAL GOOD to be working the streets of Southeast with Sampson again. It 
always is, even on a horror-show murder case that can make my blood boil over. Our last 
big case had taken place in North Carolina and California, but Sampson had been around 
only for the beginning and end of it. The two of us have been fast friends since we were 
nine or ten, and growing up in this same neighborhood. We get closer every year it 
seems. No, we do get closer. 

"What's our primary goal here, Sugar?" Sampson asked as we walked along G Street. He 
had on the black leather car coat, nasty Wayfarer sunglasses, a slick black bandanna. It 
worked for him. 

"How do we know that we did good today?" he asked. 

"We get the word out that we're personally looking for the Truth School killer," I said. 
"We show our pretty faces around. 

Make the families here feel as safe as we can." 

"Yeah, and then we catch Chop-It-Off-Chucky and chop his off," Sampson said and 
grinned like the big bad wolf that he can be. "I'm not kidding." 

I didn't doubt it for a minute. 

When I finally got home that night, it was past ten. Nana Mama was waiting up for me. 
She had already put Damon and Jannie to bed. The concerned look on her face told me 
that she couldn't get to sleep, which is unusual for her. Nana could sleep in the eye of a 
hurricane. Sometimes, she is the eye of a hurricane. 

"Hello, sweetheart," she said to me. "Bad day for you? I can see that it was." Sometimes 
she can be unbelievably sympathetic and kind and sweet, too. I like that she goes both 
ways equally well, and I can never predict which way is coming at me next. 

As we sat together on the living room couch, my eighty-one-year-old grandmother held 
my hand in both of hers. I told her what I knew so far. She was shaking slightly and that 
wasn't like her, either. She is not a weak person, not in any way She rarely shows her 
fear to anyone, even me. Nana Mama does not seem to be losing anything of herself; 
instead, she is becoming more luminous and concentrated. 

"I feel so bad about this killing at the Sojourner Truth School," Nana said, and her head 
lowered. 

"I know. It's all I've thought about today I'm working every angle I can." 

"You know much about Sojourner Truth, Alex?" 


"I know she was a powerful abolitionist, an ex-slave." 

"Sojourner Truth should be talked about when they mention Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Alex. She couldn't read, so she memorized most of the Bible for her 
teaching. She actually helped stop segregation of the transportation system here in 
Washington. And now we have this abomination at the school named in her honor. 

"Catch him, Alex," Nana suddenly whispered in a low, almost desperate, voice. "Please 
catch this terrible man. I can't even say the name they call him -- this Chucky. He's real, 
Alex. He's not a made-up bogeyman." 

I would definitely try my damnedest. I was on the murder case. 

I was chasing down the chimera as best I could. 

My mind was working overtime already. A child molester? Boys and girls. Now a child 
killer? Chop-It-Off-Chucky? Was he real, or had he been made up by frightened 
children ? Was he a chimera ? Had he murdered Shanelle Green ? 

I needed to pound the piano on our porch for a little while after Nana went up to bed. I 
played "Jazz Baby" and "The Man I Love," but the piano wasn't the ticket that night. 

Just before I fell off to sleep, I remembered something. Senator Daniel Fitzpatrick had 
been murdered in Georgetown. What a day it had been. What a nightmare. 

Two of them. 

Sam and Sara. 

Whoever they really were, the two of them lay on their stomachs on a tasteful, knock-off 
Persian rug in the small living room of her Washington pied-hid-terre. It was a kind of 
safe house. A fire blazed and crackled; fragrant apple logs were being crisped. They 
were playing a board game on the rug, which covered a hatched parquet floor. It was a 
special game. Unique in every way. The game of life and death, they called it. 

"I feel like a damn Washington, D.C., Georgetown University white liberal yuppie," Sam 
Harrison said and smiled at the unlikely image created in his mind. 

"Hey, I resemble that remark." Sara Rosen made a pouting face. She was kidding. She 
and Sam weren't yuppies. Sam certainly wasn't. 

And yet a guinea hen was roasting in the kitchen, the aroma sweetening the air. They 
were playing a parlor game on the living room rug. 

The game wasn't anything like Monopoly or Risk, though. 


Actually, they were playing a game to choose their next murder target. In turn, they 
calmly rolled the dice, then moved a marker around a rectangle of photos. The photos 
were of very famous people. 

The board game was important to Jack and Jill. It was a game of chance. It made it 
impossible for the police or FBI to predict their movements or their motive. 

If there was a motive. But of course there was a motive. 

Sam rolled the dice again. Then he moved the marker. Sara watched him in the warm, 
flickering glow of the fire. Her eyes glazed over slightly She was remembering their very 
first meeting, the initial contact between them. The beginning of every thing that was 
happening now. 

This was how the complex and beautiful and very mysterious game had begun. They had 
agreed to meet at a coffee shop inside a bookstore in downtown D.C. Sara had arrived 
first, her heart trapped in her throat. Everything about the meeting was insane, maybe 
dangerously insane, and insanely irresistible to her. She couldn't pass up this chance, this 
opportunity, or especially this cause. The cause was everything to her. 

At the time of their first meeting, she had no idea what Sam Harrison would look like, 
and she was surprised and delighted when he sat at her table. He excited her. 

She had seen him enter the coffeehouse area, watched him order espresso and a scone. 
She hadn't imagined that the dreamy-looking man at the counter would turn out to be 
Harrison, though. 

So this was The Soldier. This was her potential partner. He kind of fit in at the 
bookstore. He would fit in anywhere. He didn't look like a killer, but then again, neither 
did she. He looks a little like an airline pilot, Sara thought as she sized him up. A 
successful Washington lawyer? He was over six feet tall, trim and fit. 

He had a strong, confident face. And he also had the brightest, clearest blue eyes. He 
had a sensitive, gentle look about him. 

Not at all what she had expected. She liked him immediately She knew that they agreed 
on the important things in life, that they shared a vision. 

"You're looking at me as if I'm supposed to be a bad person, and you're surprised that I'm 
not," he'd said as he sat across from her at the cafe "I'm not a bad person, Sara. You can 
call me Sam, by the way I'm a pretty good guy, actually" 

No, Sam was much better than that. He was amazing -- extremely smart, strong, and yet 
always considerate of her feelings, and committed to their cause. Sara Rosen had fallen 
in love with him within a week of their meeting. She knew that she shouldn't, but she 
had; and now here they were. Living this secret life. 


Playing the game of life and death as a guinea hen slowly spun on the spit. Sitting before 
a cozy fire. Thinking about making love -- at least, she was. She thought about being 
with Sam, with Jack, all the time. She loved it when he was inside her. 

"This roll should do it," Sam said, and he handed her the dice. 
"Your turn. Six rolls for each of us. You do the honors, Sara." 
"Here we go, huh?" 
"Yes, here we go again." 
Sara Rosen's heart began to thunder. She could feel it thump, thump under her blouse. 


She had the paralyzing thought that this single roll of the dice was like the murder itself. 
It was almost as if she were pulling the trigger right now. 


Who was going to die next? It was all in her hand, wasn't it? Who would it be? 
She squeezed the three dice incredibly tight. Then she shook them and let the dice go, 
watched them wobble and roll forward and then stop abruptly, as if someone had pulled 
an invisible string. She quickly added up the number of the roll -- nine. 


Sara picked up the marker and counted off nine places, nine photographs. 
She stared down at the face of the next target, the next celebrity to die. It was a woman! 
It's for the cause, she told herself, but Sara Rosen's heart continued to beat loudly all the 


same. 
The next victim was a very famous woman. 
Washington, the whole world, would be shocked and outraged for a second time. 
SAMPSON AND I walked into the fog-shrouded heart of Garfield Park, which borders 


the Anacostia River and the Eisenhower Freeway and isn't far from the Sojourner Truth 


School. The color of truth is gray, I was thinking as we entered the ground smog. 
Always gray. We weren't out for an early-morning run -- we were hurrying to the place 
where Shanelle Green had actually been murdered, her skull crushed by some fiend. 

Several uniforms, a captain, and another detective were already at the homicide scene. A 
dozen or so casual onlookers were on hand -- looky-loos. Search dogs originally brought 
in from Georgia had led a search party to the murder site. I could see Sixth Street from 
the thicket of evergreens where the killer had brutally savaged the little girl. I could 
almost see the Sojourner Truth School. 


"Think he carried the body out of here to the school yard?" 

Sampson asked. His tone of voice indicated he didn't believe it. Neither did I. So how 
did the little girl's body get to the school yard? 

A bright red balloon floated a couple of feet above the overgrown bushes where the 
terrible murder had occurred. 

"O marks the spot?" Sampson asked. "That balloon the marker?" 

"I don't know... I wonder," I muttered as I pushed aside the thick evergreen branches and 
made my way into the hideaway. 

The smell of pine was heavy, even in the cold air. Reminded me that the Christmas 
season was here. 

I could feel the presence of the killer inside the tree branches, challenging me. I sensed 
Shanelle's presence as well, as if she were trying to tell me something. I wanted to be 
alone in here for a moment or two. 

It was a small clearing where the murder had actually taken place. Dried blood was on 
the ground and had even splashed across some of the branches. He lured her in here. 
How did he do that? She'd be suspicious, or scared, unless she knew him from the 
neighborhood. It suddenly struck me. The balloon! It was just a guess, but it seemed 
right to me. The red balloon could have been the lure, the killer bait for the little girl. 

I crouched down and was very still inside the tent of trees. 

The killer liked it in here, hiding in the darkness. He doesn't like himself much, though. 
Prefers the dark. He likes his mind, his thoughts, but not what he looks like. There 
probably something distinctive about him physically. 

I didn't know any of that for sure, but it seemed right; it felt right as I crouched at the 
murder site. 

He was hiding in here, probably because there something about him people might 
remember. If so, it was a good clue. 

I could see Shanelie Green's battered face again. Then an image of my dead wife, Maria, 
came to me. I could feel the rage climbing from my gut to my throat, blowing and 
billowing inside me. I thought of Jannie and Damon. 

I had one more thought about the child killer: anger usually implies an awareness of self-
worth. Strange, but true. The killer was angry because he believed in himself much 
more than the world did. 


Finally, I rose up and pushed my way back out of the hideaway. I'd had enough. 

"Haul down that balloon," I called to a patrolman. "Get that damn balloon out of the tree 
now. It's evidence." 

THERE WAS SOMETHING distinctive about him physically. I was almost certain of it. 
It was a place to start. 

That afternoon Sampson and I were out on the street again, working near the Northfield 
Village projects. The Washington newspapers and TV hadn't bothered much about the 
murder of a little girl in Southeast. Instead, they were filled with stories about the killing 
of Senator Fitzpatrick by the so-called Jack and Jill stalkers. Shanelle Green didn't seem 
to matter very much. 

Except to Sampson and me. We had seen Shanelle's broken body and met her 
heartbroken parents. Now we talked to our street sources, but also to our neighbors. We 
continued to let people see us working, walking the streets. 

"I sure do love a good homicide. Love walking the mean streets in the dead cold of 
winter," Sampson opined as we went past a local dealer's black-on-blackJeep. It was 
blaring rap, lots of bass. 

"Love the suffering, the stench, the funky sounds." His face was flat. Beyond angry. 
Philosophical. 

He was wearing a familiar sweatshirt under his open topcoat. 

The shirt had his message for the day: 

I DON'T GIVE A SHIT 

I DON'T TAKE ANY SHIT 

I'M NOT IN THE SHIT BUSINESS 

Concise. Accurate. Very much John Sampson. 

Neither of us had felt much like talking for the past hour or so. It wasn't going all that 
well. That was The Job, though. It was like this more often than it wasn't. 

Man Mountain and I arrived at the Capitol City Market about four in the afternoon. The 
Cap is a popular gyp joint on Eighth Street. It's just about the dingiest, most depressing 
bargain-basement store in Washington, D.C.- and that takes some doing. 


The featured products are usually written in pink chalk on a gray blue cinder block wall 
in front. That day the specials were cold beer and soda pop, plantains, pork rinds, 
Tampax, and Lotto -- your basic complete-and-balanced breakfast. 

A young brother with tight wraparound Wayfarer sunglasses, a shaved head, and small 
goatee caught our immediate attention in front of the minimart. He was standing next to 
another man who had a chocolate bar hanging from his mouth like a cigar. 

The shaved head motioned to me that he wanted to talk to us, but not right there. 

"You trust that rowdyass?" Sampson asked as we followed at a safe distance. "Alvin 
Jackson." 

"I trust everybody." I winked. No wink came back from Sampson. 

"You are badly fucked-up, Sugar," he said. His eyes were still seriously hooded. 

"Just trying to do the right thing." 

"Ah, yeah, you're trying too hard, then." 

"That's why you love me." 

"Yes, it is," Sampson said and finally grinned. "If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be 
right," he talk-sang a familiar lyric. 

We met Roadrunner Alvin Jackson around the corner. 

Sampson and I had occasionally used Alvin as a snitch. He wasn't a bad man, really, but 
he was living a dangerous life that could suddenly get much, much worse for him. He 
had been a decent high school track star who used to practice in the streets. Now he was 
running a little base and selling smoke as well. In many ways, Alvin Jackson was still a 
man-child. That was important to understand about a lot of these kids, even the most 
dangerous and powerful-looking ones. 

"Thalilshanelle," Alvin said as if the three words were one, "you still lookin' for 
information on who ice her and alladat?" 

Alvin's car coat was unbuttoned. He was sporting the current fashion look that's called 
jailin', or baggin'. His red-and-white pinstriped underwear was visible above the 
waistband. The look is inspired by the fact that a prisoner's belt is taken away in jail, 
tending to make the trousers droop and the underwear be accentuated. Role models for 
our neighborhood. 

"Yeah. What have you heard about her, Alvin, but no Chipmunks?" Sampson said. 


"Man, I'm tryin' to do you a solid," Alvin Jackson protested in my direction. His shaved 
head never stopped bobbing. His hoop earring jangled: His long, powerful arms 
twitched. He kept picking his Nike-sneakered feet up and putting them back down. 

"We appreciate it," I told him. "Smoke?" I offered Alvin a Camel. Joe Cool, right? 

He took it. I don't smoke, but I always carry. Alvin had smoked like a chimney when he 
was a high school road-and-track man. 

Things you notice. 

"Lil' Shanelie, she live in my auntie's building. Over in Northfield? I think I know 'bout 
somebody maybe 'sponsible. 

You unnerstand what I'm sayin'?" 

"So far." Sampson nodded. He was trying to be nice, actually, A head of lettuce could 
follow Alvin Jackson's patter. 

"You want to show us what yo, I don't want to be right," he talk-sang a familiar lyric. 

We met Roadrunner Alvin Jackson around the corner. 

Sampson and I had occasionally used Alvin as a snitch. He wasn't a bad man, really, but 
he was living a dangerous life that could suddenly get much, much worse for him. He 
had been a decent high school track star who used to practice in the streets. Now he was 
running a little base and selling smoke as well. In many ways, Alvin Jackson was still a 
man-child. That was important to understand about a lot of these kids, even the most 
dangerous and powerful-looking ones. 

"Thalilshanelle," Alvin said as if the three words were one, "you still lookin' for 
information on who ice her and alladat?" 

Alvin's car coat was unbuttoned. He was sporting the current fashion look that's called 
jailin', or baggin'. His red-and-white pinstriped underwear was visible above the 
waistband. The look is inspired by the fact that a prisoner's belt is taken away in jail, 
tending to make the trousers droop and the underwear be accentuated. Role models for 
our neighborhood. 

"Yeah. What have you heard about her, Alvin, but no Chipmunks?" Sampson said. 

"Man, I'm tryin' to do you a solid," Alvin Jackson protested in my direction. His shaved 
head never stopped bobbing. His hoop earring jangled: His long, powerful arms 
twitched. He kept picking his Nike-sneakered feet up and putting them back down. 

"We appreciate it," I told him. "Smoke?" I offered Alvin a Camel. Joe Cool, right? 


He took it. I don't smoke, but I always carry. Alvin had smoked like a chimney when he 
was a high school road-and-track man. 

Things you notice. 

"Lil' Shanelie, she live in my auntie's building. Over in Northfield? I think I know 'bout 
somebody maybe 'sponsible. 

You unnerstand what I'm sayin'?" 

"So far." Sampson nodded. He was trying to be nice, actually, A head of lettuce could 
follow Alvin Jackson's patter. 

"You want to show us what you got?" I asked him. "Help us out here?" 

"I'll show you Chucky myself. Howzat?" He smiled and nodded at me. "But only cuz it's 
you and Sampson. I tried to tell some a them other detectives, months back. They 
wouldn't have none of it. Man, they wouldn't listen to jack shit. Didn't have the time of 
day for my airplay." 

I felt like his father or uncle or older brother. I felt responsible. 

I didn't like it so much. 

"Well, we're listening," I told him. "We've got the time for you." 

Sampson and I went with Alvin Jackson to the Northfield Village projects. Northfield is 
one of the most dangerous crime areas in D.C. Nobody seems to care, though. The 1st 
District police have given up. You visit Northfield once, it's hard to blame them 
completely, This didn't seem like a very promising lead to me. But Alvin.Jackson was a 
man on a mission. I wondered why that was. What was I missing here? 

He pointed a long, accusatory finger at one of the yellow-brick buildings. It was in the 
same shabby state of disrepair as most of the others. An electric-blue metal sign was 
over the double front doors: BULI)L6 3. The front stairs were cracked and looked as if 
they'd been hit by lightning or somebody's sledgehammer. 

"He lives in there. Ak-ak city. Leastways, he did. Name's Emmanuel Perez. Sometimes 
he works as a porter at Famous. 

You know, Famous Pizza? He goes after the little kids, man. Real freakazoid. He's a 
nasty fucker. Scary fucker, too. Don't like it none when you call him Manny, He's Eeman-
uel. Insists on it." 

"How do you know Emmanuel?" Sampson asked. 


Alvin Jackson's eyes suddenly clouded over and looked hard as rocks. He took a few 
seconds before he spoke. "I knew him. 

He was around when I was a little kid. Buggin' back then, too. 

Emmanuel always been around, you unnerstand?" 

I got it. I understood now. Chop-It-Off-Chucky wasn't a chimera anymore. 

There was an asphalt-topped playground across the quad. 

Young kids were playing hoops, but not very well. The basket had no net. The rim was 
bent this way and that. Nobody any good played on these particular courts. Suddenly, 
something in the playground caught Alvin Jackson's eye. 

"That's him over there," he said in a high-pitched whine. 

Fearful. "That's him, man. That's Emmanuel Perez doggin' those kids." 

He had no sooner said the words when perez spotted us. It was as weird as a bad dream. 
I saw that he had a longish red beard that stuck out stiffly from his chin. It was 
something distinctive about him physically. Something people would have remembered 
if he'd been seen in Garfield Park. He leveled Alvin Jackson with a dark, scary look. 
Then he took off in a dead run. 

Emmanuel Perez was a very fast runner. But so were we; at least, we were the last time I 
checked. 

c aplerlO 

SAMPSON AND I raced behind Perez, closing a little ground on him. We shot down a 
littered, twisting concrete alley that ran between the tall, depressing buildings. We could 
both still move pretty well. 

"Stop! Police detectives!" I yelled loudly at the sorry excuse for a man running ahead of 
us. Bogeyman? Chimera? Innocent restaurant porter? 

Perez, the suspected child murderer and child molester, was definitely trying to escape. 
We didn't know for sure if he was Chop-It-Off-Chucky, but he had some reason to run 
from Sampson and me, from the police. 

Had we finally caught a break on the case? Something sure as hell was happening right 
now. 


I had a very bad thought lodged in the front of my brain. If we're this close to catching 


him, after two days on the streets, why wasn't he caught before? 
I thought I knew the answer, and I didn't like it much. Because nobody cares what 
happens in these wretched neighborhoods around the projects. Nobody cares. 


"We're back!" Sampson suddenly shouted as we sprinted between the cavernous 
buildings, stirring up street garbage in our wake, rousting pigeons. 
"Remains to be seen," I yelled to him. 
Nobody cares! 
"Don't doubt it for a minute, Sugar. Think only positive thoughts." 
"Emmanuel is fast, too. That's positively the ruth." 
Nobody cares! 
"We're faster, stronger, tougher than Manny ever dreamed of being." 
"Better trash talkers," I huffed. Just one huff, but a huff all the same. 


"That, too, Sugar. Goes without saying." 
We followed Perez/Chop-It-Off out onto Seventh Street, which is lined with four- and 
five-story row houses, bombed-out stores, a few tank bars. 


Perez suddenly turned into a beaten-down Federal-style building near the middle of the 
block. The windows were mostly boarded with sheet metal, looking like silver teeth in a 
rotting mouth. 

"He seems to know what the hell he's doing," Sampson yelled. 
"Knows where he's going." 
"At least that makes one of us." 
Sampson and I entered the sagging, ramshackle building several strides behind Perez. 


The strong smell of urine and decay was everywhere. As we climbed the steep, 
reinforced concrete stairs, I could feel a fire spreading into my chest. 
"Had his escape route all figured out!" I huffed. A definite huff. 
"He's smart." 



"He's trying to escape from us. That's not too smart. Never happen... 
WE GOT YOU, MANNY!" Sampson yelled up the stairs. 
His voice echoed like thunder in the narrow quarters. "HEY, MANNY! MANNY, 


MANNY, MANNY!" 


"Stop! Police! Manny Perez, stop!" Sampson shouted at the fleeing suspect. He had his 
gun out, a nasty 9mm Glock. 
We could hear Perez still running above us, his sneakers slapping stairs. He didn't yell 

back. Nobody else was on the stairs or in any of the stairwells. Nobody cared that there 
was a police chase going on inside the building. 

"You think Perez really did it?" I yelled to Sampson. 
"He did something. He's running like his ass is on fire. Spreading right up his spinal 
cord." 


"Yeah. We lit the fuse." 
We burst out a gray metal door Onto a broad, uneven expanse of tar roof. Overhead the 
sky was a cool, hard blue. There were shiny surfaces and maximum glare everywhere. 


There was nothing but bright blue sky above. I had the urge to take off--fly away from all 
of this. The urge, but not the means. 
Where the hell had he gone? He was nowhere in sight. Where was Emmanuel Perez? 


Where was the Sojourner Truth School killer? 
Chimera. 
"FUCK YOU, peachfuzz," Perez suddenly yelled. "You hear me, peachfuzz?" 
"Peachfuzz?" Sampson looked at me and made a face. 
I saw a quick flash of Chop-it-Off-Chucky He was off to our extreme right. He was 


sprinting across a connecting rooftop and was already about thirty yards away I saw him 


grab a quick, worried look back over his shoulder. 
His small eyes were hard black beads, evil-looking as they come. He had that weird red 
beard. Maybe he was a total psycho. 


Or maybe he really was just a pizza-store porter? Forget it, I told myself. 
Four teenage boys and a girl were up there on the roof doing their sneaky business. 
Crack, probably I hoped they weren't snorting heroin. They idly watched the wild, wild 



world go by The real city game was in progress here. Cops and robbers. Child molester-
killers. It made no difference to these kids. 

Sampson and I covered three more narrow rooftops in a powerful hurry. We were gaining 
on him a little, but only by a step or two. Sweat was running down my forehead and 
cheeks, burning my eyes. 

"Stop! We'll shoot!" I yelled. "Stop, Emmanuel Perez? 

Perez looked back again. He looked straight at me this time and grinned! Then he 
seemed to disappear over the far side of the brick-walled building. 

"Fire escape!" Sampson yelled. 

Seconds later, the two of us were rushing headlong down skinny, twisting, rusted metal 
stairs. Perez flew down the flimsy fire escape ahead of us. He was really moving. This 
was definitely his event, his home course. 

Sampson and I were both too big for the tight-radius maneuvering. He gained a full 
flight on us, maybe a flight and a half. 

Chucky definitely had an escape route figured out, I was thinking. 

He'd practiced this. I was almost sure of it. He a smart one. He guilty. Those vicious 
eyes! Mad-dog eyes. What had Alvin Jackson said -- that Emmanuel Perez had always 
been around? 

We saw him down on E Street. The red beard jutted out as if it were petrified wood. He 
was already a full block away Lots of rush-hour traffic everywhere. He was getting into 
a gypsy cab, a dull red-and-orange hack that read, CAPPY'S. WE GO ANYWHERE. 

"STOP, YOU FUCKING SQUIRREL!" Sampson screamed at the top of his voice. 
"GODDAMN YOU, MANNY!" 

Perez gave us the finger in the crud-crusted rear window of the cab. 

"PEACHFUZZ!" he leaned out and screamed back at us. 

SAMPSON AND I scrambled out onto E Street. Sweat was still streaming down my 
forehead and cheeks, my neck, back, legs. 

Sampson ran in front of a Yellow Cab and the driver screeched to a stop. Intelligent of 
the cabdriver to avoid hitting Man Mountain and totaling his car. 

"Metro police! Detective Alex Cross!" my voice boomed as we simultaneously swung 
open the cab's back doors. "Follow that hack. Go! Go! Go! Dammit." 


"Don't you lose him!" Sampson threatened the driver. "Don't you even think about it." 
The poor man was scared to death. He never even looked back. Never said a word. But 
he didn't lose visual contact with CAPPY'S. WE GO ANYWHERE. 

We hit a bad snarl of traffic at Ninth Street where it approaches Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Cars and trucks were backed up for at least three blocks. Angry horns were honking 
everywhere. One tractor-trailer had a foghorn like an oceangoing vessel's. 

"Maybe we better get out and run him down," I said to Sampson. 

"I was thinking the same thing. Let's go for it." 

It was one of those fifty-fifty calls. Either way, we could lose Chucky right here. My 
heart was pounding hard in my chest. I could see the crushed-in skull of little Shanelie 
Green. Emmanuel had always been around! Those mad-dog eyes! I wanted Chop-ItOff-
Chucky real bad. 

Sampson already had the creaking door on his side of the cab open. I was half a step 
behind. Maybe less. 

Chucky must have felt us breathing fire on the back of his neck. He jumped out of his 
cab and started to run. 

We followed him between the tight rows of barely moving traffic. 

Blaring car horns provided chaotic background noise for the foot chase along Ninth 
Street. 

Chop-It-off-Chucky burst forward. He'd gotten his second wind. 

Suddenly, he veered right and into a gleaming, glass-and-steel office building. The 
building looked silver blue. 

Madness, pure and simple. 

I had my detective's shield already out as we entered the office building several strides 
behind Chucky. "Spanish guy, red beard. Which way?" I yelled at the dazed and 
confused-looking security guard standing around in the plush, paneled lobby. 

He pointed to the middle car at a metal-on-metal elevator bank. The car had already left 
the ground floor. I watched the floor indicator: three -- four -- rising fast. Sampson and I 
jumped into the open door of the car nearest the front entrance. 

I hit ROOFTOP with the palm of my hand. That was my best guess. 


"Roadrunner said Perez was a porter at Famous Pizza," I told Sampson. "There was a 
Famous on the ground floor here." 

"Think Chucky's a creature of habit? Likes roofs? Has his favorites all picked out?" 
"I think he had a couple of escape routes figured out, just in case. And, yeah, I think he's 
a creature of habit." 


"He's most definitely a creature." 
The elevator bell rang, and Sampson and I scrambled out, guns first. We could see the 


Capitol in the distance. Also the Statue of Freedom. Pretty sight under other 
circumstances. 
Weird, now. Kind of sad. 
I couldn't stop thinking about Shanelie Green. I kept seeing her brutalized face. What 


had he hit her with? How many times? 


Why? I wanted to catch this bastard so bad, it hurt. Hurt my body; hurt my head even 
worse. 
We moved away from the building, and I finally spotted Chucky outlined against the 


skyline. My heart sank. 


Chucky did have an escape route in mind. He had thought about this before. Somebody 
coming to get him. He sure was acting guilty. He had to be our killer. 
"Fuck you, peachfuzz!" he screeched, taunting us again. 
Then he took off on a long, running start. He had a powerful stride -- a long stride. 
"No," I moaned. "No, no, no." 
I knew what he was going to do. 
Perez was going to jump from building to building. 
"Stop, you son of a bitch," Sampson shouted, "or I will shoot!" 
But he didn't stop. We watched him take a flying leap. 
We ran to the edge of the roof, both of us screaming at the top of our lungs. There was a 


second office building catty-corner to our roof. The top of that building was a floor below 
where Sampson and I now stood. 


Chop-It-Off-Chucky was airborne between the buildings, the glass-and-steel caverns. 

"Jesus!" I gasped as I peered straight down over the side. The gap between the buildings 
was at least twenty feet wide, maybe more. 

"Fall, you bastard. Hit a wall," Sampson yelled at the flying figure. "Go down, Chucky!" 

He done this before. He practiced his escape, I thought as I watched. No wonder he 
never been caught. How many years on the loose? How many kids molested or 
murdered? 

We had our guns out, but neither of us fired. We had no proof that he was the killer. He 
had only run from us, had never pointed a weapon. Now, this insane leap from one office 
building to another. 

Chucky looked suspended in motion sixteen floors up. A long, long way down. 

Something was wrong. 

Chucky was pumping his legs furiously It was as if he were trying to pedal a bike straight 
across the sky His long arms reached out, muscles hard and taut. His lead leg stretched 
until it was almost straight out from his body. Nike sneaker-poster stuff. 

His frame was stiff, like a runner caught in a prizewinning photograph. 

"Jesus Christ," Sampson whispered at my side. I felt his warm breath on my cheek. 

Chucky's arm was outstretched, but his hand barely touched the restraining wall on the 
roof of the nearby office building, his legs still pumping in midair. 

Then Chop-It-Off-Chucky screamed -- bloodcurdling sounds, muffled only by the 
windows and walls of the two buildings. 

He continued to shriek as he fell twenty stories. His arms and legs were flailing, stroking 
the air at a futile, furious pace. 

As I watched, I saw his body suddenly twist in midair. 

He looked up at me -- still screaming in a hopeless, plaintive way, screaming with his 
mouth and his eyes, and that bushy red beard, screaming. Chucky was dying as I 
watched. The fall seemed to take forever. Four or five seconds that seemed like an 
eternity My stomach was falling with him. I experienced vertigo. The narrow alley 
below was a spinning gray band. The buildings, the canyon, seemed so steep and dark 
and faraway Then I heard Chucky hit the pavement. Splat! It was other-worldly to hear. 


I stared at the crumpled body spread-eagled down below. I could feel no joy in it, 
though. There was nothing even remotely human about it. It was crushed like the side of 
Shanelle Green's face, Chucky's unearthly screams still echoed inside my brain. 

"Flameout," Sampson said at my side. "Case closed. Score one for the peachfuzz." 

I holstered my semiautomatic. Emmanuel Perez had practiced his escape, but he hadn't 
practiced enough. 

MAJOR FAKEOUT. Faked you out something fierce, didn't I? I faked you all out. 

The real Sojourner Truth School killer was alive and well. The killer couldn't have been 
any better, thank you very much. He had just committed the perfect crime, hadn't he? 
He had just gotten away with murder. 

Yes, he sure as hell had. Scot-free. The crackerjack Washington police had caught and 
toasted the wrong twisted asshole. Somebody named Emmanuel Perez had paid for his 
sins, paid with his life, paid in full. 

All he had to do now was cool it, he knew. That was what he had to concentrate on. He 
had already decided to hide out for a while -- inside his mind. 

He was cruising the Pentagon City mall in Arlington. 

He was getting absolutely rabid as he strolled through The Gap, and then Victoria's 
Secret. He was obsessing about how to get back at -- anybody and everybody. At tout le 
monde -- pardon his French, s'il vous plait. 

A song, an oldie he'd heard that morning on MTV, was stuck in his head. The lyrics had 
been bouncing around in his skull like ?ing-Pong balls for the last couple of hours. He 
could hear the singer, Beck, a hopeless geek from Los Angeles: I'm a loser, baby. So 
why don't you kill me? 

I'm a loser, baby. So why don't you kill me? he repeated the lyric in his head. 

I'm a loser, baby. So why don't you kill me? 

He loved the way the dumb-ass lyrics worked two ways for him. They were about him, 
and they were about his potential victims. Everything was an irritating circle, right? Life 
was beautiful in its screwy simplicity, right? 

WRONG! Life was not beautiful. Not at all. 

He was watching a little sucker now, a potential victim who looked way too good to pass 
up. The.Truth School killer loitered inside the Toys "R" Us at the mall Since it was the 
holiday season, the store was jam-packed with idiots. 


The overhead speakers were playing the chain's irritating and moronic theme song: "I 
don't wanna grow up, I'm a Toys 'R' Us kid." Over and over and over, the kind of 
mindless repetition that kids loved. The sheer number of insane toys, the spoiled-rotten 
little kids, the smug-looking mothers and fathers, the whole raw deal made him feel hot, 
thickheaded, and almost physically sick. 

I don't want to grow up, either, he said to himself. I'm a Toys "R" Us kid killer. 

He watched his chosen little boy as the kid wandered alone down a wide aisle chock-full 
of action games. The boy was five or so, a very manageable age. 

The anger button inside his head was going off like a powerful alarm. WOM! WOM! 
WOM! The terrible feeling quickly spread to his chest. WOM! WOM! It was tense and 
uncomfortable. Both his hands were clenched tight. So was his stomach. The back of 
his neck. His brain was clutching, too. 

Be careful now, he cautioned himself. Don't make any mistakes. 

Remember if you do perfect crimes. 

THIS WAS GOING TO BE a mite tricky going, though, working in the crowded Toys 
"R" Us store. What if the boy's parents were close by? WHICH THEY DEFINITELY 
WERE! What if he were caught? WHICH HE WOULDN'T BE! COULDN'T BE! 

That was incredibly important to him. Just watching the attractive, round-faced, sandy-
haired boy, he could feel how badly this particular kid would be missed and, even better, 
mourned. 

He needed to imagine the stories that would bombard the television screens and the thrill 
of watching them, knowing he was responsible for so much pain and suffering and 
emergency activity. 

The little boy was getting itchy in his woolens and starting to panic a little. He had big 
crocodile tears brimming in his eyes. 

There didn't seem to be anybody, any adult, anywhere around him. Poor Little Boy Lost. 
Poor Little Boy Blue. 

The killer began to move in on his prey, slowly and carefully. 

He couldn't stop now. His heart was beating like a big tin drum, and he loved the 
powerful sensation. His legs and arms were a little wobbly. Jell-O city. His vision 
tunneled; he was dizzy with anticipation, fear, dread, exhilaration. 

Do it. 


Now! 

He bent, picked up the boy, and immediatelyoking mothers and fathers, the whole raw 
deal made him feel hot, thickheaded, and almost physically sick. 

I don't want to grow up, either, he said to himself. I'm a Toys "R" Us kid killer.

Do it. 


Now! 


He bent, picked up the boy, and immediately started smiling and talking the happiest, 
friendliest barf-babble he could come up with. 
"Hi there, I'm Roger the Artful Dodger. I work here at Toys 'R' Us. What kind of 


fantastical toys do you like best, huh? We've got every' kind of toy in the whole wide 
world, 'cause we're the world's biggest, coolest toy store. Yahoo! How 'bout that? Let's 
go find your superpathetic mom and dad!" 

The boy actually smiled up at him. Kids could do weird mood changes like that. His 
beautiful blue eyes sparkled, glistened; something wet and wonderful happened. "I want 
Mighty Max," he proclaimed as if he were Richie Rich instead of Little Boy Lost. 

"Okay, then come with me. One Mighty Max coming up! 
Why? 'Cause you're a Toys 'R' Us kid." 
He cradled the boy in his arms and began to hurry up the wide shopping aisle toward the 


front of the store. Suddenly, he knew he could get away with it, even something this 
audacious and shocking, with almost a hundred eyewitnesses in the store. Hey, he was 
the new Pied Piper. Kids loved him. 

"We'll get a Vac-Man. Then how about X-men? Or how about a Stretch Armstrong?" 
"Mighty Max," the little boy repeated, stuck on his one track. 
"I only want Mighty Max." 
The killer peeked out of aisle three. He was less than thirty feet from the store's front 


exit. The mall parking lot bordered on Columbia Park, which had been part of his escape 
package from the start. 
He took a couple of fast steps, then stopped dead in his tracks at the front of the store. 
Shit! A couple in their late twenties were walking toward him! 
The woman looked just like Little Boy Blue. 
They had him... dead to rights. They had him nailed! They had him! 


He knew what he had to do, so he never panicked for a nanosecond. 
Except for the two or three major heart attacks he had on the inside. Well, here goes 
everything. Time to bet the ranchero. 



"Hey, hi there." He smiled broadly and went into his best stand-up routine ever. "This 
little guy belong to you? He was lost in the action-figure section. Nobody came for him. 
I figured I better bring him up to the store manager. Little guy was crying his eyes out. 
You his mom?" 

The mother reached out for her precious bundle of joy, while at the same time throwing 
her husband a dirty look. 

Aha, there was our villain! Pop was obviously the one who had lost the boy in the first 
place. Pops couldn't get anything right these days, could they! His own pop sure hadn't 
been able to. 

"Thank you, so much," the mom said. She tossed another incredibly nasty look to pop. 
"That was very sweet of you," she told the killer. 

He continued to hold his best smile. Man, he was acting his heart out. "Anybody would 
do the same thing. He's a nice little boy. Well, so long. Bye-bye. He wants a Mighty 
Max. That's probably what he was searching for." 

"Yes, he does want Mighty Max. Bye. Thanks again," said the mom. 

"Bye-bye," the little boy mimicked, waving his hand. 

"Bye-bye." 

"Hope see ya some other time," said the Sojourner Truth School killer. "Bye-bye." You 
morons! You incredible idiots. 

You pathetic simps. 

He walked away from the family. Never looked back once. 

He was wetting his pants, but he was also beginning to laugh. 

He couldn't stop himself from laughing. Here was another thing in his favor -- even if he 
was caught someday -- they wouldn't believe that he was the Truth School killer. No way 
in hell. 

AH, THIS WAS MUCH BETTER. Life was good again. I opened my eyes and Jannie 
was there, staring at me from about three feet away. Jannie had Rosie the cat in her arms. 
Jannie likes to watch me sleep sometimes. I like to watch her sleep, too. Fair is fair. 

"Hey there, sweetness and light," I said to her. "You know the song, "Someone To 
Watch Over Me'? You remember that one?" 

I hummed a couple of bars for her. 


Jannie nodded her head yes. She knew the song. She'd heard me play it on the piano 
downstairs, on our porch. "You have guests," she announced. 

I sat up in bed. "How long have they been here?" 
"They just came. Nana sent me and Rosie up to get you. She's making them coffee. 
You, too. You have to get up." 


"Is it Sampson and Rakeem Powell?" I asked. 


Jannie shook her head. She seemed unusually shy this morning, which isn't really like 
her. "They're white men." 
I was starting to wake up in a hurry "I see. You happen to catch the names?" Suddenly, I 


thought I knew the names. I solved the mystery myself-- at least, I thought I had. 
Jannie said, "Mr. Pittman and Mr. Clouser." 
"Very good," I complimented her. 
Not good, not good at all, I was thinking about my "guests." I didn't want to see the chief 


of detectives, or the police commissioner -- especially not in my house. 
Especially not for the reason I imagined that they were here to see me. 
Jannie bent and gave me my morning kiss. Then a second kiss. 
"Oh, what lies there are in kisses," I winked and said to her. 
"Nope," she said. "Not my kisses." 
It took me less than five minutes to get as ready as I was going to get for this. Nana was 


entertaining our visitors in the parlor. 


Commissioner Clouser had come to my house twice before. This was a first for the chief 
of detectives. The Jefe. I assumed that Clouser had forced him to come. 
ChiefPittman and Commissioner Clouser were sipping Nana's steaming coffee, smiling at 


a story she was spinning for them. I wondered what it was she had decided to get off her 


chest. This was a dangerous time -- for Pittman and Clouser. 
"I was just rebuking these gentlemen for allowing Emmanuel Perez to roam our streets 
for so long," she told me as I entered the parlor. "They promised not to let that sort of 
thing happen again. Should I believe them, Alex?" 



Both Pittman and Clouser chuckled as they looked at me. 

Neither of them realized this was no chuckling matter, and that my grandmother was no 
one to mess with or, even worse, condescend to in her house. 

"No, you shouldn't believe one word they say Are you finished now?" I asked her, 
returning her sweet, phony smile with one of my own. 

"I didn't think I could trust either of them. I wanted to get their promise in writing," Nana 
said. 

I nodded and smiled, as if she'd just made a joke, which I knew she hadn't. She was dead 
serious. The Jefe and Commissioner Clouser both laughed heartily They thought Nana 
Mama was a stitch. She isn't. She's the whole nine yards. 

"Can the three of us talk in here?" I asked her. "Or should we go outside for our 
discussion?" 

"I'll go in my kitchen," Nana evil-eyed me and said. "So nice to meet you, Chief Pittman, 
Commissioner Clouscr. Don't forget your promise. I won't." 

Once she had left the room, the commissioner poke right up "Well, congratulations are in 
order, Alex. I understand that you found all kinds of kiddie porn in Manuel Pcrez's 
apartment." 

"Detective Sampson and I found the pornography," I said. 

Then I was silent. I had decided not to make this easy for them. 

Actually, I agreed one hundred percent with the point Nana had been trying to make. 

"I'm sure you're wondering what we're doing here, so let me explain," Chief of Detectives 
Pittman spoke up. He and I were not close, to put it mildly. Never had been, never 
would be. 

Pittman is a bully and also a closet racist, and those are his better points. He could never 
seem to see a belt without wanting to hit below it. 

"I'd appreciate it," I said to The Jefe. "I was thinking that maybe you had just been in the 
neighborhood and you dropped by for my grandmother's coffee. It's worth a trip." 

Pittman didn't come close to breaking a smile. "We received a formal request from the 
FBI late last night. They've asked that you work on the investigation of Senator 
Fitzpatrick's murder. 


Special Agent Kyle Craig strongly suggested that your background and recent experience 
might serve the investigation well. 
Obviously, it's an important case, Alex." 
I let Chief Pittman finish, then I slowly shook my head no. 
"I've got a half-dozen open homicides here in Southeast," I said. 


"The case I just worked on should have been solved months ago. 
Then another little girl wouldn't have died for no goddamn reason. A homicide detective 
got reassigned off the killer's trail back then. 


Now a little girl is dead. Six years old." 
"This is a major case, Alex," the commissioner said. He had snow-white hair. His face 


was bright red, which happened when he was angry or disturbed. The two of us went 
back some. Usually, we went along, got along. Maybe not this time. 
"Tell the FBI that I can't be spared for this Jack and Jill mess. 
I'll call Kyle and make my peace with him. Kyle will understand. 
I'm on several homicide cases in Southeast. People die here, too. 
We have our own messes, and even major cases." 
"Let me ask you something, Alex," the police commissioner said. He smiled gently as he 


spoke. Lots of beautifully capped white teeth. I could have played some sweet Gershwin 
on them, though maybe some key-slamming Little Richard would have been more 
satisfying. 

"Do you still want to be a cop?" he asked. 
That one landed, and it stung. It was a sucker punch, but a pretty good one. 
"I want to be a good cop," I said to him. "I want to do some good if I possibly can. Same 


as always. Nothing's changed." 
"That's the right answer," the commissioner said as if I were a child who needed his 


instruction. "You're on the Jack and Jill investigation. It's been decided in very high 
places. You have experience with these kinds of murders, with lunatic psychotics. 
You are officially off all your other cases. Now, be a very good cop, Alex. The FBI is 

almost certain Jack and Jill are going to kill again." 


So was I, so was I. 

And I felt the very same thing about the Sojourner Truth School killer. 

I RESISTED the unique charms of the Jack and Jill case for one more day. Half a day, 
anyway. I tried to clear a few things on my watch in Southeast. I was furious about what 
had happened with Clouser and Pittman. 

Shanelie Green had died because more detectives hadn't been assigned to find Chop-ItOff-
Chucky, hadn't given Alvin Jackson the time of day The whole sorry affair was race-
related, no way around it, and it made me both angry and sad. 

I came home early and spent the evening with Nana and the kids. I wanted to make sure 
they were okay after the murder at the Sojourner Truth School. At least that horror tale 
had been solved. But I still wasn't over the child killing. I couldn't get past it for a lot of 
reasons. 

For half an hour or so, I gave Damon andJannie their weekly boxing lesson in the 
basement. To Damon's credit, he's never complained that the sessions include his sister. 
He just puts on the gloves. 

They're becoming tough little pugs, but more important, they're learning when not to 
fight. Not many kids mess with them at school, but that's mainly because they're nice 
kids and know how to get along. 

"Watch that footwork, Damon," I told him. "You're not supposed to be putting out a fire 
with your feet." 

"You're supposed to be dancing," Jannie threw a little verbal jab at her brother. "Step, 
right. Back. Step, step, left." 

"I'll do a dance on you in a minute," Damon warned her off, and then they both laughed 
like hell. 

A little later, we were upstairs in front of the tube. Jannie was crossing her small arms, 
squinting her brown eyes, and making a tough-as-nails face at me. It was her official, 
nonnegotiable bedtime, but she had decided to lodge a protest. 

"No, Daddy. Nope, nope, nopeee," she said. "Your watch is too fast." 

"Yes Jannie. Yep, yep yepeee." I held my ground, held my own against my chief 
nemesis. "My watch is too slow." 

"No, siree. No way," she said. 


"Yes, indeedee. No escaping it. You're busted." 

The long arm of the law finally reached out and corralled another repeat offender. I 
grabbed Jannie off the couch and carried my little girl up to bed at eight-thirty on the dot. 
Law and order reigns at the Cross house. 

"Where we going, Daddy?" she giggled against my neck. "Are we going out for ice 
cream? I'll have pralines 'n' cream." 

"In your dreams." 

As I tightly held Jannie in my arms, I couldn't help thinking about little Shanelle Green. 
When I had seen Shanelle in that school yard, I was scared. I'd thought of Jannie. It was 
a vicious circle that kept playing inside my head. 

I lived in fear of the human monsters coming to our house. 

One of them had come here a few years back. Gary Soneji. That time no one had been 
hurt, and we had been very lucky Jannie and I had worked out a prayer that we both 
liked. 

She knelt beside her bed and said the words in a beautiful little whisper. 

Jannie said, "God up in heaven, my grandma and my daddy love me. Even Damon loves 
me. I thank you, God, for making me a nice person, pretty and funny sometimes. I will 
always try to do the right thing, if I can. This is Jannie Cross saying goodnight." 

"Amen Jannie Cross," I smiled and said to my girl. I loved her more than life itself. She 
reminded me of her mother in the best possible way. "I'll see you in the morning. I can't 
wait." 

Jannie grinned and her eyes widened suddenly. She popped back up in bed. "You can 
see me some more tonight. Just let me stay up," she said. "I scream for ice cream." 

"You are funny," I said and kissed her goodnight. "And pretty and smart." Man, I love 
her and Damon so much. I knew that was why the child murder had really gotten under 
my skin. The madman had struck too close to our house. 

Maybe for that reason Damon and I went for a walk a little later that night. I draped my 
arm over my son's shoulders. It seemed as if every day he got a little bigger, stronger, 
harder. We were good buddies, and I was glad it had worked out this way so far. 

The two of us strolled in the direction of Damon's school. On the way, we passed a 
Baptist church with angry, dark-red and black graffiti markings: I don't care 'boutJeez, ' 
causeJeez don't care 'bout me. That was a common sentiment around here, especially 
among the young and restless. 


One of Damon schoolmates had died at the Sojourner Truth School. What a horrible 
tragedy, and yet he had already seen so much of it. Damon had witnessed a death in the 
street, one young man shooting another over a parking space, when he was only six years 
old. 

"You ever get afraid to be at the school? Tell me the truth. 

Whatever you really feel is okay to say, Damon," I gently reminded him. "I get afraid 
sometimes, too. Beavis and Butt-head scares me. Ren and Stimpy, too." 

Damon smiled, and he shrugged his shoulders. "I'm afraid sometimes, yeah. I was 
shivering on our first day back. Our school isn't going to close down, is it?" 

I smiled on the inside, but kept a straight face. "No, there'll be classes as usual tomorrow. 
Homework, too." 

"I did it already," Damon answered defensively. Nana has him a little too sensitive about 
grades, but that probably isn't so terribly bad. "I get mostly all OKs, just like you." 

"Mostly all Ks," I laughed. "What kind of sentence is that?" 

"Accurate." He grinned like a young hyena who had just been told a pretty good joke on 
the Serengeti. 

I grabbed Damon in a loose, playful headlock. I gently slid my knuckles over the top of 
his short haircut. Noogies. He was okay for now. He was strong, and he was a good 
person. I love him like crazy, and I wanted him to always know that. 

Damon wiggled out of the headlock. He danced a fancy Sugar Ray Leonard-style two-
step and fired a few quick, testing punches at my stomach. He was showing me what a 
tough little cub he was. I had no doubt about it. 

Right about then I noticed someone leaving the school building. 

It was the same woman I'd seen in the early morning of Shanelie Green's murder. The 
one who had blown me away then. 

She was watching Damon and me tussle on the sidewalk. She had stopped walking to 
watch us. 

She was tall and slender, almost six feet. I couldn't see her face very well in the shadows 
of the school building. I remembered her from the other morning, though. I remembered 
her self-confidence, a sense of mystery I'd felt about her. 


She waved, and Damon waved back. Then she headed down to the same dark blue 
Mercedes, which was parked up against the wall of the building. 

"You know her?" I asked. 

"That's the new principal of our school," Damon informed me. 

"That's Mrs. Johnson." 

I nodded. Mrs. Johnson. "She works late. I'm impressed. How do you like Mrs. 
Johnson?" I asked Damon as I watched her walk to her car. I remembered that Nana had 
talked about the principal and been very positive about her, calling her "inspirational" and 
saying she had a sweet disposition. 

She was certainly attractive, and seeing her made my heart ache just a little. The truth 
was, I missed not having someone in my life. I was getting over a complicated friendship 
I'd had with a woman- Kate McTiernan. I had been working a lot, avoiding the whole 
issue that fall. I was still avoiding it that night. 

Damon didn't hesitate with his answer to my question. "I like her. Everybody likes Mrs. 
Johnson. She's tough, though. She's even tougher than you are, Daddy," he said. 

She didn't look so tough with her Mercedes sedan, but I had no reason not to believe my 
son. She was definitely brave to be in the school alone at night. Maybe a little too brave. 

"Let's head on home," I finally said to Damon. "I just remembered this is a school night 
for you." 

"Let's stay up and watch the Bullets play the Orlando Magic," he coaxed and grabbed 
onto my elbow. 

"Oh -- sure. No, let's get Jannie up and we'll all pull an all-nighter," I said and laughed 
loudly. We both laughed, sharing the jokey moment. 

I slept in with the kids that night. I was definitely not over the murder at the Truth 
School. Sometimes, we'll throw blankets and pillows on the floor and sleep there as if we 
were homeless. It gives Nana fits, but I believe she thrives on her fits, so we make 
certain she has one every other week or so. 

As I lay there with my eyes open, and both kids sleeping peacefully, I couldn't help 
thinking about Shanelie Green. It was the last thing I needed to think about. Why had 
someone brought the body back to the school yard? I wondered. There are always loose 
ends on cases, but this one made no sense, so it concerned me. It was a piece that didn't 
fit in a puzzle that was supposed to be finished. 


Then I began thinking about Mrs. Johnson for a moment or two. That was a better place 
to be. She's even tougher than you are, Daddy. What a glowing recommendation from 
my little man. It was almost a dare. Everybody likes Mrs. Johnson, Damon had said. 

I wondered what her first name was. I made a wild guess -- Christine. The name just 
came to me. Christine. I liked the sound of it in my head. 

I finally nodded off to sleep. I slept with the kids in the pile of blankets and pillows on 
the bedroom floor. No monsters visited us that night. I wouldn't let them. 

The dragonslayer was on guard. Tired and sleepy and oversentimental, but ever so 
watchful. 

THIS WAS REALLY NUTS, insane, demented. It was so great The killer wanted to go 
for it again, right now. Right this minute. He wanted to do the two of them. What a gas 
that would be. What a large charge. A real shockeroo. 

He had watched them from afar --father and son. He thought of his own father, the 
totally worthless prick. up and watch the Bullets play the Orlando Magic," he coaxed and 
grabbed onto my elbow.

He had watched them from afar --father and son. He thought of his own father, the 
totally worthless prick. 

Then he saw the tall, pretty schoolteacher wave and get into her car. Instinctively, he 
hated her, too. Worthless black bitch. 

Phony teacher smile spread all over her face. 

POW! POW! POW! 

Three perfect headshots. 

Three exploding head melons. 

That what they all deserved. Summary executions. 

A really rude thought was forming in his mind as he watched the scene near the school. 
He already knew a lot of things about Alex Cross. Cross was his detective, wasn't he? 
Cross had been assigned to his case, right? So Cross was his meat. A cop, just like his 
own father had been. 

The really interesting thing was that nobody had paid much attention to the first killing. 
The murder had almost gone unnoticed. The papers in Washington had barely picked it 
up. Same with TV. Nobody cared about a little black girl in Southeast. Why the hell 
should they? 

All they cared about was Jack and Jill. Rich white people afraid for their lives. Scary! 
Well, fuck Jack and Jill. He was better than Jack and Jill, and he was going to 
demonstrate it. 

The school principal drove past his hiding place in a cluster of overgrown bushes. He 
knew who she was, too. Mrs. Johnson of the Truth School. The Whitney Houston of 
Southeast, right? 

Screw her, man. 

His eyes slowly drifted back to Alex Cross and his son. He felt anger rising inside him, 
steam building up. It was as if his secret button had been pushed again. The hair on his 
neck was standing at attention. He was beginning to see red, feeling spraying mists of red 


in his brain. Somebodyblood, right? Cross's? His son's? He loved the idea of them 
dying together. He could see it, man. 

He followed Alex Cross and his kid home- in his rage state -- but keeping a safe distance. 
He was thinking about what he was going to do next. 

He was better than Jack and Jill. He'd prove it to Cross and everyone else. 

THE FESTIVE charity gala for the Council on Mental Health was being held at the 
Pension Building on F Street and Fourth on Friday night. The grand ballroom was three 
stories, with huge marble columns everywhere, and more than a thousand guests noisily 
seated around a glistening working fountain. The waiters and waitresses wore Santa 
Claus hats. The band broke into a lively swing version of "Winter Wonderland." What 
great fun. 

The guest speaker for the evening was none other than the Princess of Wales. Sam 
Harrison was there as well. Jack was there. 

He observed Princess Di closely as she entered the glittering, stately ballroom. Her 
entourage included a financier rumored to be her next husband, the Brazilian ambassador 
and his wife, and several celebrities from the chic American fashion world: Ironically, 
two of the models in the group appeared to suffer from anorexia nervosa m the flip side 
of bulimia, the nervous disorder that had plagued Diana for the previous dozen years. 

Jack moved a few steps closer to Princess Di. He was in-trigned, and had serious 
questions about the quality of her security arrangement. He watched the Secret Service 
boys make a discreet sweep, then remain on duty nearby, earphones at the ready A formal 
toastmaster had been brought all the way from England to properly salute the queen- the 
council's presidentand host Walter Annenberg. The ambassador spoke briefly, then a 
lavish, though overcooked and underspiced, din-her followed: baby lamb with sauce 
Niqoise and haricots verts. 

When the princess finally rose to speak during dessert, an orange almond tart with orange 
sauce and Marsala cream, Jack was less than thirty feet away from her. She wore an 
expensive gold sheath of taffeta with sequins, but he found her somewhat gawky, at least 
to his taste. Her large feet made him think of the cartoon character Daisy Duck. Princess 
Daisy, that was his moniker for Di. 

Diana's speech at the gala was very personal, if familiar, to those who had followed her 
life closely. A troubled childhood and adolescence, a debilitating search for perfection, 
feelings of self-revulsion and low personal esteem. All this had led to what she spoke of 
as her "shameful friend," bulimia. 

Jack found the speech strangely off-putting and cloying. He wasn't at all touched by 
Diana's self-pity, or the near hysteria that seemed to reside just below the surface of her 
performance --perhaps her entire life. 


The audience clearly had a different reaction, even the usually cool-as-ice Secret Service 
guards seemed to react emotionally to the popular Di. The applause when she had 
finished speaking was thunderous and seemed heartfelt and sincere. 

Then the entire room stood up Jack included, and continued the warm, noisy tribute. He 
could almost have reached out and touched Di. Here to bulimia, he wanted to call out. 
Here's to worthwhile causes of all kinds. 

It was time for him to move into action again. It was time for number two in the Jack and 
Jill story. Time for a lot of things to begin. 

It was also his turn to be the star tonight- to solo, as it were. He had been watching 
another well-known personality that evening at the party He had watched her, studied her 
habits and mannerisms on a few other occasions as well. 

Natalie Sheehan was physically striking, much more so than Di, actually The much-
admired TV newswoman was blond, about five eight in heels. She wore a simple, 
classic, black silk dress. She oozed charm, but especially class. First class. Natalie 
Sheehan had been aptly described as "American royalty, an American princess." 

Jack started to move at a little past nine-thirty Guests were already dancing to an eight-
piece band. The breezy chitchat was flowing freely: Marion Gingrich's business 
dealings, trade problems with China, John Major's problems du jour, planned ski trips to 
Aspen, Whistler, or Alta. 

She had downed three margaritas -- straight up, with salt around the rim. He had watched 
her. She didn't show it but she had to be feeling something, had to be a little high. 

She was an extremely good actor, Jack was thinking as he came up beside her at one of 
the complimentary bars. She a master of the one-night stand and the one-weekend affair. 
Jill had researched the hell out of her. I know everything about you, Natalie. 

He took two sidelong steps, and suddenly they were face to face. They nearly collided, 
actually He could smell her perfume. 

Flowers and spices. Very nice. He even knew the delightful fragrance's name- ESCADA 
acre 2. He'd read that it was Natalie's favorite. 

"I'm sorry. Excuse me," he said, feeling his cheeks redden. 

"No, no. I wasn't looking where I was going. Clumsy me," Natalie said and smiled. It 
was her killer TV close-up smile. 

Really something to experience firsthand. 


Jack smiled back, and suddenly his eyes communicated recognition. 


He knew her. "You never forgot a name, or a face, not in eleven years of broadcasting," 
he said to Natalie Sheehan. "That's an accurate quote, I believe." 
Natalie didn't miss a beat. "You're Scott Cookson. We met at the Meridian. It was in 


early September. You're a lawyer with... 
a prestigious D.C. law firm. Of course." 
She laughed at her small joke. Nice laugh. Beautiful lips and perfectly capped teeth. 


The Natalie Sheehan. His target for the evening. 


"We did meet at the Meridian?" she said, checking her facts like the good reporter she 
was. "You are Scott Cookson?" 
"We did, and I am. You had another affair to attend after that, at the British embassy." 
"You seem never to forget a face or factoid, either," she said. 
The smile remained fixed. Perfect, glowing, almost effervescent. 
The TV star in real life, if this was real life. 
Jack shrugged, and acted shy, which wasn't so hard to do with Natalie. "Some faces, 


some factoids," he said. 
She was classically beautiful, extremely attractive at any rate, he couldn't help thinking. 
The warm heartland smile was her trademark, and it worked very well for her. He had 


studied it for hours before tonight. He wasn't completely immune to her charms -- not 
even under the circumstances. 
"Well," Natalie said to him. "I don't have another party after this one. Actually, I'm 


cutting back on parties. Believe it or not. 
This is a good cause, though." 
"I agree. I believe in good causes." 
"Oh, and what's your favorite cause, Scott?" 
"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," he said. 
"That's my pet cause." 



He tried to look pleasantly surprised that she would remain talking with him. He could 
play parlor games as well as anyone -- when he had to, when he wanted to. 

"If I might be just a little bold," he said, "would you consider the two of us cutting back 
together?" His very natural and unassuming smile undercut the forward-sounding line. It 
was a come-on just the same. There was no disguising that. Natalie Sheehan's answer 
was tremendously important, to both of them. 

She stared at him, slightly taken aback. He'd completely blown it, he thought. Or maybe 
she was acting now. 

Then Natalie Sheehan laughed. It was a hearty laugh, almost raucous. He was sure that 
no one in America had ever heard it in her prim and proper role as a network television 
reporter. 

Poor Natalie, Jack thought. Number two. 

NATALIE TOOK another margarita for the trip home. "A roadie," she told him and 
laughed that deep, wonderful laugh of hers again. 

"I learned how to party a little bit at St. Catherine's Academy in Cleveland. Then at 
Ohio State," she confided as they walked to the garage under the Pension Building. She 
was trying to show him that she was different from her television persona. Looser, more 
fun. He got that much, got the message. He even liked her for it. He was noticing that 
her usually crisp and exact enunciation was just a little off now. She probably thought it 
was sexy, and she was right. She was actually very nice, very down-to-earth, which 
surprised him a little. 

They took her' car, as Jill had accurately predicted. Natalie drove the silverblue Dodge 
Stealth a little too fast. All the while she talked rapid-fire, too, but kept it interesting: 
GATT, Boris Yeltsin's drinking problems, D.C. real estate, campaign-financing reform. 
She showed herself to be intelligent, informed, high-spirited, and only slightly neurotic 
about the ongoing struggle between men and women. 

"Where are we going?" he finally thought he should ask. He already knew the answer, of 
course. The Jefferson Hotel. 

Natalie's honey trap in D.C. Her place. 

"Oh, to my laboratory," she said. "Why, are you nervous?" 

"No. Well, maybe a little nervous," he said and laughed. It was the truth. 

She brought him upstairs to her private office in the Jefferson Hotel on Sixteenth Street. 
Two beautiful rooms and a spacious bath overlooked downtown. He knew that she also 
had a house in Old Town Alexandria. Jill had visited there. Just in case. 


Just to be thorough. Measure twice. Measure five times, if necessary. 

"This place is my treat for myself. A special spot where I can work right here in the 
city," she told him. "Isn't the view breathtaking? 

It makes you feel as if you own the whole city It does for me, anyway" 

"I see what you mean. I love Washington myself," Jack said. 

For a moment he was lost, peering off into the distance. He did love this city and what it 
was supposed to represent -- at least, he had once upon a time. He still remembered his 
very first visit here. He had been a marine private, twenty years old. The Soldier. 

He quietly surveyed her workspace. Laptop computer, Canon Bubblejet, two VCRs, gold 
Emmy, pocket OAG. Fresh-cut flowers in a pink vase beside a black ceramic bowl filled 
with foreign pocket change. 

Natalie Sheehan, this is your life. Kind of impressive; kind of sad; kind of over. 

Natalie stopped and looked at him closely, almost as if she were seeing him for the first 
time. "You're very nice, aren't you? 

You strike me as being a very genuine person. The genuine article, as they say, or used 
to say You're a nice guy, aren't you, Scott Cookson?" 

"Not really," he shrugged. He rolled his sparkling blue eyes and an engaging little half-
smile appeared. He was good at this: getting the girl -- if it was necessary. Actually, 
though, under normal circumstances, he never ran around. He was at heart a one-woman 
guy 

"Nobody's really nice in Washington, right? Not after you've lived here for a while," he 
said and continued to smile. 

"I suppose that's true. I guess that's basically accurate," she snorted out a raucous laugh, 
then laughed again. At herself? He could see that Natalie was disappointed a little in his 
answer. 

She wanted, or maybe she needed, something genuine in her life. Well, so did he; and 
this was it." The game was exquisite, and it was definitely the genuine article. It was so 
important. It was history. And it was happening right now in this Jefferson Hotel suite. 

This irresistible, dangerous game he was playing, this was his life. It was something with 
meaning, and he felt fulfilled. No, he felt, for the first time in years. 

"Hi there, Scott Cookson. Did we lose you for a see?" 


"No, no. I'm right here. I'm a here-and-now kind of person. 

Just admiring the wonderful view you have here. Washington in the wee hours." 

"It's our view for tonight. Yours and mine." 

Natalie made the first physical move, which was also as he had predicted and was 
therefore reassuring to him. 

She came up close to him, from behind. She placed her long slender arms around his 
chest, bracelets jangling. It was extremely nice. She was highly desirable, almost 
overpoweringly so, and she knew it. He felt himself become aroused, become extremely 
hard down the left side of his trousers. That kind of arousal was like a small itch 
compared to everything else he was feeling now. Besides, he could use it. Let her feel 
your excitement. 

Let her touch you. 

"Are you okay with this?" she asked. She actually was nice, wasn't she? Thoughtful, 
considerate. It was too bad, really Too late to change the plan, to switch targets. Bad 
luck, Natalie. 

"I'm very okay with this, Natalie." 

"Can I take your tie off, tasteful as it is?" she asked. 

"I think that ties should be done away with altogether," he answered. 

"No, ties definitely have a place. First Communions, funerals, coronations." 

Natalie was standing very close to him. She could be so sweetly, gently seductive- and 
that was sad. He liked her more than he'd thought he would. Once upon a time, she had 
probably been the simple Midwestern beauty she now half pretended to be. He had felt 
nothing but revulsion for Daniel Fitzpatrick, but he felt a great deal tonight. Guilt, regret, 
second thoughts, compassion. The hardest thing was killing up close like this. 

"How about white pima cotton shirts? Are you a white-shirt man?" Natalie asked. 

"Don't like white shirts at all. White shirts are for funerals and coronations. And charity 
balls." 

"I agree a thousand percent with that sentiment," Natalie said as she slowly unbuttoned 
his white shirt. He let her fingers do the walking. They trailed down to his belt. Teasing. 
Expert at this. She rubbed her palm across his crotch, then quickly took her hand away. 


"How about high heels?" Natalie asked. 

"Actually, I like those on the right occasion, and on the right woman," he said. "But I 
like going barefoot, too." 

"Nicely put. Give a girl her choice. I like that." 

She kicked off just one black slingback, then laughed at her joke. A choice -- one shoe 
on, one off. 

"Silk dresses?" she whispered against his neck. He was rock-hard now. His breathing 
was labored. So was Natalie's. He considered making love to her first. Was that fair 
game? Or was it rape? Natalie had managed to confuse the issue for him. 

"I can do without those, depending on the occasion, of course," he whispered back. 

"Mmm. We seem to agree on a lot of things." 

Natalie Sheehan slid out of her dress. Then she was in her blue lacy underwear, one 
shoe, black stockings. Around her neck was a thin gold chain and cross that looked as if 
it had come with her all the way from Ohio. 

Jack still had his trousers on. But no white shirt, no tie. "Can we go in there?" she 
whispered, indicating the bedroom. ,'It's really nice in there. Same view, only with a 
fireplace. The fireplace even works. Something actually works in Washington." 

"Okay. Well, let's start a fire then." 
Jack picked her up as if she weighed nothing, as if they were both elegant dancers, which 


in a way they were. He didn't want to care about her, but he did. He forced the thought 
out of his mind. 
He couldn't think like that, like a schoolboy, a Pollyanna, a normal human being. 
"Strong, too. Hmmm," she sighed, finally kicking off the other shoe. 
The picture window in the bedroom was astonishing to behold. 
The view was north up Sixteenth Street. The streets and Scott Circle below were like a 


lovely and expensive necklace, jewelry by Harry Winston or Tiffany. Something 


Princess Di might wear. 
Jack had to remind himself that he was stalking Natalie. Nothing must stop this from 
happening now. The final decision had been made. The die was cast. Literally. 



He forced himself not to be sentimental. Just like that! He could be so cold, and so good 


at this. 
He thought about throwing the high-spirited and beautiful newswoman through the plate 
glass window of her bedroom. He wondered if she would crash through or just bounce 
back off the glass. 


Instead, he set Natalie down gently on a bed covered with an Amish quilt. He pulled out 
handcuffs from his jacket pocket. 
He let her see them. 
Natalie Sheehan frowned, her blue eyes widening in disbelief. 


She seemed to deflate, to depress, right before his eyes. 
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" She was angry with him, but she was also hurt. She 
figured he was a freak, and she was right beyond her wildest nightmares. 


His voice was very low. "No, this isn't a joke. This is very serious, Natalie. You might 


say that it's newsworthy." 
There was a sudden and very sharp knock at the door to the demi-apartment. He held up 
a finger for Natalie to be quiet, very quiet. 


Her eyes showed confusion, genuine fear, an uncustomary loss of her cool demeanor. 
His eyes were cold. They showed nothing at all. 
"That's Jill," he told Natalie Sheehan. "I'm Jack. I'm sorry. I really am." 
I EASED MY WAY inside the Jefferson Hotel just before eight in the morning. A little 


Gershwin was rolling through my head, trying to soothe the savage, trying to smooth out 
the jagged edges. 


Suddenly, I was playing the bizarre game, too. Jack and Jill. I was part of it now. 
The cool dignity of the hotel was being scrupulously main-rained; at least, it was in the 
elegant front lobby It was difficult to grasp the reality that a bizarre and unspeakable 
tragedy had struck here, or that it ever could. 


I passed a fancy grillroom and a shop displaying couture fashion. A century-old clock 
gently chimed the hour; otherwise, the room was hushed. There was no sign, not a hint, 
that the Jefferson m indeed the entire city of Washington -- was in shock and chaos over 
a pair of grisly, high-profile murders and threats of still more to come. 



I am continually fascinated by facades like the one I encountered at the Jefferson. Maybe 
that's why I love Washington so much. The hotel lobby reminded me that most things 
aren't what they appear to be. It was a perfect representation for so much that goes on in 

D.C. Clever facades fronting even morfrom his jacket pocket. 
He let her see them.

Jack and Jill had committed their second murder in five days. In this serene and very 
posh hotel. They had threatened several more murders -- and no one had a clue why, or 
how to stop the celebrity stalking. 

It was escalating. 

Clearly, it was. 

But why? What did Jack and Jill want? What was their sick game all about? 

I had already been on the phone very early that morning, talking to my strange friends in 
abnormal psych at Quantico. One of the advantages I have is that they all know I have a 
doctorate in psych from Johns Hopkins and they're willing to talk with me, even to share 
theories and insights. So far, they were stumped. 

Then checked in with a contact of mine at the FBI's evidence analysis labs. The evidence 
hounds didn't have much of anything to go on, either. They admitted as much to me. 
Jack and Jill had all of us chasing our tails in double time. 

Speaking of which, I had been ordered by the chief of detectives to work up "one of your 
famous psych profiles" on the homicidal couple, if that's what they really were. I felt the 
task was futile at this point, but hadn't been given a choice by The Jefe. Working at 
home on my PC, I ran a wide swath through the available Behavioral Science Unit and 
Violent Criminal Apprehension Program data. Nothing obvious or very useful popped 
up, as I suspected it wouldn't. It was too early in the chase, and Jack and Jill were too 
good. 

For now at least the correct steps were (1) gather as much information and data as 
possible; (2) ask the right questions, and plenty of them; (3) start collecting wild hunches 
on index cards that I would carry around until the end of the case. 

I knew about several stalker cases, and I ran the information down in my head. One 
inescapable fact was that the Bureau now had a database of more than fifty thousand 
potential and actual stalkers. That was up from less than a thousand in the 1980s. There 
didn't seem to be any single stalker profile, but many of them shared traits: first and 
foremost, obsession with the media; need for recognition; obsession with violence and 
religion; difficulty forming loving relationships of their own. I thought of Margaret Ry, 
the obsessed fan who had broken into David Letterman's home in Connecticut numerous 
times. She had called Letterman "the dominant person in my life." I watch Letterman 
sometimes myself, but he's not that good. 

Then there was the Monica Seles stabbing in Hamburg, Germany Katarina Witt had 
nearly suffered the same fate at the hand of a "fan." 

Sylvester Stallone, Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Jodie Foster had all been seriously 
stalked and attacked by people who claimed to adore them. 


But who were Jack and Jill? Why had they chosen Washington, D.C., for the murders? 
Had someone in the government harmed one or both of them in some real or imagined 
way? 

What was the link between Senator Daniel Fitzpatrick and the murdered television 
newswoman Natalie Sheehan? What could Fitzpatrick and Sheehan possibly have in 
common? They were liberals -- could that be something? Or were the killings radom, 
and therefore nearly impossible to chart? Random was a nasty word that was sticking in 
my head more and more as I thought about the case. Random was a very bad word in 
homicide circles. Random murders were almost impossible to solve. 

Most celebrity stalkers didn't murder their prey- at least, they didn't use extreme violence 
right away. That bothered the hell out of me about Jack and Jill. How long had they 
been obsessed with Senator Fitzpatrick and Natalie Sheehan? How had they ultimately 
chosen their victims? Don't let these be random selections and murders. Anything but 
that. 

I was also intrigued by the fact that there were two of them, working closely together. 

I had just come off a dizzying, high-profile case in which two friends, two males, had 
been kidnapping and murdering women for more than thirteen years. They had been 
cooperating, but also competing with each other. The psychological principle involved 
was known as twinning. 

So what about Jack and Jill? Were theyfreak-friends? Were they romantically involved? 
Or was their bond something else? Was it a sexual thing for them? That seemed like a 
reasonable possibility. 

Power dominance? A really kinky parlor game, maybe the ultimate sex fantasy? Were 
they a husband-and-wife team? Or maybe spree killers like Bonnie and Clyde? 

Was this the beginning of a gruesome crime spree? A multiple-murder spree in 
Washington ? 

Would it spread elsewhere? To other large cities where celebrities tend to cluster? New 
York? Los Angeles? Paris? London? 

I stepped off the elevator on the seventh floor of the Jefferson Hotel and looked into a 
corridor of dazed and confused faces. 

Judging from the looks at the crime scene, I was pretty much up to speed. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill To kill, to kill, to kill. 


"THE GOOD DOCTOR CROSS, the master of disaster. Well, I'll be. Alex -- hey, Alex 
-- over here!" 

I was lost in a bad jumble of thoughts and impressions about the murders when I heard 
my name. I recognized the voice immediately, and it brought a smile to my lips. 

I turned and saw Kyle Craig of the FBI. Another dragonslayer, this one originally from 
Lexington, Massachusetts. Kyle was not your typical FBI agent. He was a totally 
straight shooter. He wasn't uptight, and he usually wasn't bureaucratic. Kyle and I had 
worked together on some very bad cases in the past. He was a specialist in high-profile 
crimes that were marked by extreme violence or multiple murders. Kyle was an expert in 
the nasty, scary stuff most Bureau agents didn't want to be involved with on a regular 
basis. Beyond that, he was a friend. 

"They've got all the big guns out on this one," Kyle said as we shook hands in the foyer. 
He was tall, still gaunt. Distinctive features and strikingly black hair, coal black hair. He 
had a long hawk's nose that looked sharp enough to cut. 

"Who's here so far, Kyle?" I asked him. He would have everything scoped out by now. 
He was smart and observant, and his instincts were usually good. Kyle also knew who 
everybody was and how they fit into the larger picture. 

Kyle puckered up. He made a face as if he had just sucked on a particularly sour lemon. 
"Who the hell isn't here, Alex? Detectives from D.C., your own cornpadres. The Bureau, 
of course. 

DEA, believe it or not. The blue suit is CIA. You can tell by the clipped wings. Your 
close friend Chief Pittman is in visiting with Ms. Sheehan's lovely corpse. They're in the 
boudoir as we speak." 

"Now that's scary," I said and smiled thinly. "About as grotesque as you can get." 

Kyle pointed to a closed door, which I assumed was the bedroom. 

"I don't think they want to be disturbed. A rumor circulating at Quantico has it that Chief 
of Detectives Pittman is a necrophiliac," he said with a deadpan look. "Could that be 
true?" 

"Victimless crimes," I said. 

"How about a little respect for the dead," Kyle said, peering down his nose at me. "Even 
in death, I'm certain Ms. Sheehan would find a way to rebuff your chief of detectives." 

I wasn't surprised that The Jefe himself had come to the Jefferson. This was developing 
into the biggest D.C. homicide case in years. It definitely would be if Jack and Jill 
struck again soon -- as they had promised. 


Reluctantly, I parted company with Kyle and walked toward the closed bedroom door. I 
opened it slowly, as if it might be booby-trapped. 

The one and only Chief George Pittman was in the bedroom with a man in a gray suit. 
Probably a forensics guy. They both glanced around at me. Pittman was chomping on an 
unlit Bauza cigar. Pittman frowned and shook his head when he saw who it was. 
Nothing he could do about it. It was Commissioner Clouser's invitation-order that I be on 
the case. It was obvious that The Jefe didn't want me here. 

He muttered "the late Alex Cross" to the other suit. So much for polite introductions and 
light banter. 

The two of them turned back to the famous corpse on the bed. 

Chief Pittman had been abusive for no apparent reason. I didn't let it bother me too 
much. It was business-pretty-much-as-usual with the rude, bullying prick. What a 
useless bastard, a real horseass. All he ever did was get in the way. 

I breathed in slowly a couple of times. Got into the job, the homicide scene. I walked 
over to the bed and started my routine: the collection of raw impressions. 

A G-string was pulled partly over Natalie Sheehan's head, and the waistband was 
wrapped around her throat. Panties covered her nose, chin, and mouth. Her wide blue 
eyes were fixed on the ceiling. She was still wearing black stockings and a blue bra that 
matched the panties. 

Here was evidence of kinkiness again, and yet I didn't quite believe it. Everything was 
too orderly and arranged. Why would they want us to suspect kinky sex might be 
involved? Was that something? Were Jack and Jill frustrated lovers? Was Jack 
impotent? 

We needed to know whether anyone had sex with the victim. 

It was a particularly disturbing death scene. Natalie Sheehan had been dead for about 
eight hours, according to Kyle's information. 

She was no longer beautiful, though, not even close. Ironically, she had taken her biggest 
news story with her to the grave. 

She knew Jack -- and maybe Jill. 

I could remember watching her on TV, and it was almost as if someone I knew 
personally had been murdered. Maybe that's why there's such fascination with celebrity 
murder cases. We see people like Natalie Sheehan on almost a daily basis; we come to 


think that we know them. And we believe they lead such interesting lives. Even their 
deaths are interesting. 

I could already see that there were some obvious and striking similarities to the murder of 
Senator Fitzpatrick. The element of kinky sadism for one thing. Natalie Sheehan was 
manacled to the bedposts with handcuffs. She was seminude. She also seemed to have 
been "executed," just as the senator had been. 

The news celebrity had received one close-range gunshot to the left side of her head, 
which hung to one side as if her long neck had been broken. Maybe it had been. 

Was this the Jack and Jill pattern? Organized, efficient, and cold-blooded as hell. Kinky 
for some reason known only to them. 

Pseudokinky ? Sexual obsession, or a sign of impotence? What was the pattern telling 
us? What was it communicating? 

I was beginning to formulate a psychological personality print for the killers. The 
method and style of the killings were more important to me than any physical evidence. 
Always. Both murders had been carefully planned -- methodical, very structured, and 
leisurely --Jack and Jill were playing a cold-blooded game. 

So far, there had been no significant slipups that I knew of. The only physical evidence 
left at the scenes was intentional -- the notes. 

Sexual fantasy was obvious -- both in exhibiting the female on her bed and in the 
senator's case, male mutilation. Did Jack and Jill have trouble with sex? 

My initial impression was that both killers were white, somewhere between the ages of 
thirty and forty-five- probably closer to the latter, based on the high level of organization 
in both murders. I suspected well above average intelligence, but also persuasiveness and 
physical attractiveness. That was particularly telling, and bizarre to me -- since the killers 
had managed to get inside the celebrities' apartments. It was the best clue we had. 

There was much more for me to take in, and I did, madly scribbling away in my notepad. 
Occasionally, TheJefe looked my way and glared at me. Checking up on me. 

I wanted to go at him. He represented so many things that were wrong with the 
department, the Washington PD. He was such a controlling macho asshole, and not half 
as bright as he thought he was. 

"Anything, Cross?" he finally turned and asked in his usual clipped manner. 

"Not so far," I said. 


That wasn't the truth. What definitely occurred to me was that Daniel Fitzpatrick and 
Natalie Sheehan might both have been "promiscuous," in the old-fashioned sense of the 
word. Maybe Jack and Jill "disapproved" of them. Both bodies had been left exposed, in 
compromising and very embarrassing positions. The killers seemed preoccupied with sex 
-- or at least the sex lives of famous people. 

Exposed... or to expose I wondered. Exposed for what reason? 

"I'd like to look at the note," I told Pittman, trying to be civil and professional. 

Pittman waved a hand in the direction of an end table on the far side of the bed! His 
gesture was dismissive and rude. I wouldn't treat the rawest rookie patrolman that way. I 
had shown more respect to Chop-It-Off-Chucky. 

I walked over and read the note for myself. It was another poem. 

Five lines. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill To right another error. 

To make it short Her news report Was filled with her own terror. 

I shook my head back and forth a few times, but didn't say anything about the note to 
Pittman. To hell with him. The rhyme didn't tell me much of anything yet. I hoped it 
would eventually. Actually, the rhymes were clever, but without emotion. What had 
made these two killers so clever and cold? 

I continued to search the bedroom. I was infamous in homicide circles for spending a lot 
of time at crime scenes. Sometimes I'd spend a whole day. I planned to do the same 
thing here. Most of the dead woman's effects seemed to tie in with her career, almost as 
if she had no other life. Videocassettes, expense sheets from her network, a pilfered 
stapler with CBS engraved on it. I observed the murder scene, and the dead woman, 
from several angles. I wondered if the killers had taken anything with them. 

I couldn't concentrate the way I wanted to, though. Chief Pittman had gotten on my 
nerves. I had let him get to me. 

Why had both victims been left exposed? What was it that connected them in death- at 
least in the minds of the murderers? 

The killers felt compelled to graphically point out certain things to us. In fact, everything 
about Fitzpatrick and Sheehan was in public view now. Thanks to Jack and Jill. 

This is so bad, I thought and had to reach down deep for a breath. 

Worst of all, I was completely hooked on the case. I was definitely hooked. 


Then everything took a turn for the worse in the bedroom. A bad and unexpected turn. 

I was standing near George Pittman when he spoke again, without looking at me. "You 
come back after we're finished, Cross. Come back later." 

The Jefe's words hung like stale smoke in the air. I had trouble believing that he'd 
actually said them. I have always tried to act with some respect toward Pittman. It's been 
hard, nearly impossible most of the time, but I've done it anyway. 

"I'm talking to you, Cross," Pittman raised his voice a notch. 

"You hear what I said? Do you hear me?" 

Then the chief of detectives did something he shouldn't have, something so bad, 
something I couldn't look past. He reached out and pushed me with the heel of his hand. 
Pushed me hard. 

I stumbled back a half-step. Caught my balance. Both my fists slowly rose to my chest. 

I didn't stop to think. Maybe some stored-up venom and powerful dislike made me act. 
That was part of it. 

I reached out and grabbed Pittman with both hands. This unspoken thing between us, the 
pattern of disrespect from him, had been building for a couple of years -- at least that 
long. Now it flared big-time and ugly. It exploded inside the dead woman's bedroom. 

George Pittman and i are about the same age. He's not as tall as I am, but he's probably 
heavier by thirty pounds. He has the squat, blocklike build and look of a football 
linebacker from the early sixties. He's bad at his job and he shouldn't have it. He resents 
the hell out of me because I'm decent at what I do. Fucker! 

I grabbed and picked him up, right off the floor. I look fairly strong, but I'm actually a lot 
stronger. Pittman's eyes widened in disbelief and sudden fear. 

I slammed him hard against the bedroom wall. Then banged him into the wall a second 
time. Nothing lethal or too damaging, but definitely a bell-ringer, an attention-grabber. 

Each time his body hit, the staid Jefferson Hotel seemed to shake to its very foundation. 
TheJefe's body went slack. He didn't fight back. He couldn't believe what I'd just done. 
To be honest, neither could I. 

I loosened my grip on Pittman. I finally let him go, and he wobbled on his feet. I knew I 
hadn't hurt him much physically, but I had hurt his pride. I had also made a big mistake. 

I didn't say a word. Neither did the other gray suit in the room. 


I took some solace in the fact that Pittman had pushed first. He had started this, and for 
no reason. I wondered if the other suit had seen it that way, but I doubted it. 
I left the crime-scene bedroom. Pittman never spoke to me. 


I wondered also if I had just left the Washington Police Department. 
"THIS IS AN ALERT! Something is going down at Crown. Up and at 'em, everybody! 
We've got trouble at Crown. This is a real alert! This is not a drill! This is for real." 


Half a dozen Secret Service agents took the sudden alert very seriously. They watched 
Jack through Range master binoculars, three sets of them. 

Jack was on the move. 
They couldn't believe what they were witnessing. Not one of the agents could believe 
this very bad scene playing out before them. The alert was definitely for real, though. 


"It's Jack, all right. What is he -- crazy?" 


"We have full visual contact with Jack. Where the hell is he going? Goddamn him. 
What's going on?" 
The six watchers comprised three highly professional teams. 
They were all first-teamers, among the best and brightest of more than two thousand 


Secret Service agents working around the world. They sat inside dark-colored Ford 
sedans parked on Fifteenth Street Northwest. This was getting very serious, and very 
scary, in a hurry. 

This is a real alert. 
This is not a drill. 
"Jack is definitely leaving Crown now. It's twenty-three forty. 
At this moment, we have Jack in our crosshairs," one of the agents spoke into the car 


mike. 


"Yeah. Jack can be a real tricky fellow, though. He's proven it before. Keep him right in 
your sights. Where's the lovely Jill, home base?" 
"This is home base," a female agent's voice came onto the line immediately 


"Jill is nice and comfy up on the third floor of Crown. She's reading Barbara Bush on 
Barbara Bush. She's in her jammies. Not to worry about Jill." 
"We're absolutely sure about that?" 
"Home base is sure about Jill. Jill's in bed. Jill is being a good girl, for tonight anyway" 


"Good for Jill. How the hell did Jack get out?" 
"He used that old tunnel between the basement of Crown and the Treasury Building. 
That's how he got out!" 


This is an alert. 
This is not a drill. 
Jack is on the move. 
"Jack is approaching Pennsylvania Avenue now. He's near the Willard Hotel. He just 


glanced back over his shoulder. Jack's paranoid, as well he should be. I don't think he 
saw us. Oh, shit, somebody just flashed their high beams in front of the Willard. 
A vehicle is pulling out -- and pulling up alongside Jack! RedJeep! 


Jack is getting inside the fucking redJeep." 
"Roger. So much for having Jack in our damn crosshairs. We'll follow him pronto. 
Virginia plates on the Jeep. License number two-three-one HCY. Koons dealer sticker. 
Start a te -- crazy?" 


"We have full visual contact with Jack. Where the hell is he going? Goddamn him. 
What's going on?"

alert for the Jackal. This is not a drill!" 
"Do not lose Jack tonight of all nights. Do not lose Jack under any circumstances." 
"Roger. We have Jack in plain sight." 



Three dark sedans took off in hot pursuit of the Jeep. Jack was the Secret Service's code 
name for President Thomas Byrnes. 

Jill was the code name for the First Lady. Crown had been the Service's code word for 
the White House for nearly twenty years. 

Most of the current-duty agents genuinely liked President Byrnes. He was a down-toearth 
guy, a very regular person as recent presidents went. Not too much bullshit about 
him. Occasionally, though, the President took off on an unannounced date with some 
lady friend, either in D.C. or on the road. The Secret Service referred to this as "the 
president's disease." Thomas Byrnes was hardly the first to suffer from this malady. John 
Kennedy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and especially Lyndon Johnson had been the worst 
offenders. It seemed to be a perk of high office. 

The coincidence of the names chosen by the two psychopathic killers in D.C., the so-
called celebrity stalkers, wasn't lost on the Secret Service. The Secret Service didn't 
believe in coincidences. They had already met four times on the matter -- long, difficult 
meetings in the Emergency Command Center in the West Wing basement of the White 
House. The name for any would-be assassins of the president was Jackal. 

Jackal had been used by the Secret Service for more than thirty years. 

The "coincidence" of the names worried the PPD, the Presidential Protection Division, a 
great deal- especially.when President Byrnes decided to go out on one of his 
unannounced walks, which for obvious reasons didn't include any of his bodyguards. 

There were two Jacks and two Jills. 

The Secret Service did not, could not, accept this as a coincidence. 

"We've lost the red Jeep around the Tidal Basin. We've lost Jack," an agent's voice 
suddenly exploded over the car-radio speakers. 

Everything was chaos. Full-alert chaos. 

This was not a test. 

PART 2 

DRAGONSLAYER 

ON MONDAY NIGHT something.finally broke on Jack and Jill. 

It was something potentially big. I hoped it wasn't a hoax. 


I'd just gotten home to try and catch a bite of dinner with the kids when the phone rang. 
It was Kyle Craig. He told me a videotaped message, reportedly from Jack and Jill, had 
been delivered to the CNN studios. The killers had made a home movie for the world to 
see. Jack and Jill had also sent cover letters to the Washington Post and the New York 
Times. They were planning to "explain" themselves that night. 

I had to rush out before Nana's roast chicken hit the supper table. Jannie and Damon gave 
me their not-again looks. They were right to think that way. 

I hurried to the Union Station section of Washington, around H and North Capitol. I 
didn't want to be late for the party that Jack andJillwere throwing. This was another 
example of the two of them demonstrating their control over us. 

I arrived at CNN headquarters just in time for the screening and only moments before the 
video was to be aired on Larry King Live. Senior agents from the FBI and Secret Service 
were crowded into a low-key, cozy CNN viewing room. So were various techies, 
administrators, and lawyers from the news network. Everybody looked incredibly tense 
and uptight. 

The room was completely silent as the filmed message from Jack and Jill began. I was 
afraid to blink. We all were. 

"You believe this shit?" somebody finally muttered. 

Jack and Jill had been filming us! That was the first shock of the night. They had 
actually filmed the police outside Senator Fitzpatrick's apartment building a few days 
earlier. They had been right there in the crowd of onlookers, the ambulance-chasers. 

The film was a jarring, documentary-style collage of black and white, with some color. 
The opening shots were from several angles outside Senator Fitzpatrick's building. It was 
like a well-made student film, but a little artsy. Then something even more unexpected 
and powerful came on the screen. 

The murderers had filmed the last moments of Senator Fitzpatrick's life, seconds before 
his murder, I guessed. There were haunting shots of the senator alive. It got worse from 
there. 

We saw graphic shots of Daniel Fitzpatrick, naked, handcuffed to his bed. We heard his 
voice. "Please don't do this," he pleaded with his captors. Then we heard the click of a 
trigger. 

A shot was fired only an inch or two from Fitzpatrick's right ear. Then came a second 
shot. The senator's head exploded on film. People gasped at the awful image and sound 
that carried the senator into eternity. 


"Oh, Jesus! Jesus!" a woman screamed. Several people looked away from the screen. 
Others covered their eyes. I stayed with it. I couldn't miss anything. This was all vital 
information for the case that I was trying to understand. This was more valuable than all 
the DNA testing, serology, and fingerprinting in the world. 

The tone of the film suddenly changed after the footage of Fitzpatrick's vicious murder. 
Images of ordinary people on the streets of unidentified cities and small towns followed 
the chilling death sequence. A few of the people on camera waved, some smiled broadly, 
most seemed indifferent as they were being filmed, presumably by Jack and Jill. 

The film continued to weave together black-and-white and color footage, but not in a 
disorderly fashion. Whoever had stitched it together had a decent skill for editing. 

One of them is an artist, or at least has strong artistic tendencies, I thought to myself and 
made a mental note. What kind of artist would be involved in something like this? I was 
familiar with several theories about links between creativity and psychopaths. 

Bundy, Dahmer, even Manson, could be considered "creative" killers. On the other hand, 
Richard Wagner, Degas, Jean Genet, and many other artists had exhibited psychopathic 
behavior in their lives, but they didn't kill anyone. 

Then, about sixty-five seconds into the film, a narration began. 

We heard two voices: a man's and a woman's. Something dramatic was happening. It 
caught all of us by surprise. 

Jack and Jill had decided to speak to us. 

It was almost as if the killers were right there in the studio. The two of them alternated 
speaking as the film collage continued, but both voices had been electronically filtered, 
presumably so they couldn't be recognized. I would move on unscrambling the voices as 
soon as the show was over. But the show sure wasn't over yet. 

jacK: For a long time, people like us have sat back and taken the injustices dished out by 
the elite few in this country. We have been patient and suffering and, for the most part, 
silent. 

What is the cynical saying -- don't just do something, sit there ? We have waited for the 
American system of checks and balances to take hold and work for us. But the system 
has not worked for a long, long time. Nothing seems to work anymore. Does anyone 
seriously dispute that? 

JXLL: Unscrupulous people, such as lawyers and businessmen, have learned to take 
advantage of our innocence and our goodwill and, most of all, our generosity of spirit. 
Let us repeat that important thought--highly unscrupulous people have learned to take 


advantage of our innocence, our goodwill, and our wonderful American spirit. Many of 
them are in our government, or work closely with our so-called leaders. 

jacK: Look at the faces before you in this film. These are the disenfranchised. These are 
the people without any hope, or any belief in our country anymore. These are the victims 
of the violence that originates in Washington, in New York, in Los Angeles. Do you 
recognize the disenfranchised? Are you one of the victims? We are. We're just another 
Jack and Jill in the crowd. 

JLL: Look at what our so-called leaders have done to us. Look at the despair and 
suffering our leaders are responsible for. Look at the sickness of cynicism they've 
created. The dreams and hopes they have wantonly destroyed. Our leaders are 
systematically destroying America. 

jack Look at the faces. 

JILL: Look at the faces. 

jac: Look at the faces. Now do you understand why we are coming to get you? Do you 
see?... Just look at the faces. Look at what you have done. Look at the unspeakable 
crimes you have committed. 

ju.: Jack and Jill have come to The Hill. This is why we're here. Beware to all those who 
work and live in the capital, and attempt to control the rest of us. You've been playing 
with all of our lives -- now we're going to play with yours. It's our turn to play. It's Jack 
and Jill's turn. 

The film ended with striking images of masses of homeless people in Lafayette Square, 
right across from the White House. 

Then another poem, another warning rhyme. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill On a grave and somber mission. 

You've made them mad The time's so bad To be a politician. 

jack These are the times that try men without souls. You know who you are. So do we. 

"How long does their little masterpiece run?" One of the television producers wanted an 
answer to the most practical of questions. 

CNN was supposed to be on the air live with the film in less than ten minutes. 

"Just over three minutes. Seemed like forever, I know," a technician with a stopwatch 
reported. "If you're thinking about editing it down, tell me right now." 


I felt a chill after hearing the rhyme, even though the viewing room was warm. No one 
had left yet. The CNN people were talking among themselves, discussing the film, as if 
the rest of us weren't even there. The talk-show host was looking pensive and troubled. 
Maybe he understood where mass communications was heading, and realized it couldn't 
be stopped. 

"We're live in eight minutes," a producer announced to his crew. "We need this room, 
people. We're going to make dupes for all of you." 

"Souvenirs," someone in the crowd quipped. "I saw Jack and Jill on CNN." 

"They're not serial killers," I said in a soft mumble, more for myself than anyone else. I 
wanted to hear what the thought, the hunch, sounded like out loud. 

I was in the minority, but my belief was strong. They're not pattern killers, not in the 
ordinary sense. They were extremely organized and careful, though. They were clever 
or personable enough to get close to a couple of famous people. They had a hang-up with 
kinky sex, or maybe they just wanted us to think so. They had some kind of overarching 
cause. 

I could still hear their words, their eerie voices on the tape: "On a grave and somber 
mission." 

Maybe this wasn't a game to them. It was a war. 

IT WAS the worst of times; it was the worst of times. On Wednesday morning, just two 
days after Shanelie Green's murder, a second murdered child was found in Garfield Park, 
not far from the Sojourner Truth School. This time the victim was a seven-year-old boy. 
The crime was similar. The child's face had been crushed, possibly with a metal club or 
pipe. 

I could walk from my house on Fifth Street to the horrifying murder scene. I did just 
that, but I dragged my feet. It was the fourth of December and children were already 
thinking of Christmas. This shouldn't have been happening. Not ever, but especially not 
then. 

I felt bad for another reason, besides the murder of another innocent child. Unless 
someone was copycatting the first murder, and that seemed highly unlikely to me, the 
killer couldn't have been Emmanuel Perez, couldn't have been Chop-it-Off-Chucky. 
Sampson and I had made a mistake. We had run down the wrong child molester. We 
were partly responsible for his death. 

The wind swirled and howled across the small park as I entered across from the bodega. 
It was a miserable morning, terribly cold and darkly overcast. Two ambulances and a 
half-dozen police cruisers were parked on the grounds inside the rim of the park. 


There were at least a hundred people from the neighborhood at the crime scene. It was 
eerie, ghastly, completely unreal. Police and ambulance sirens screamed in the 
background, a terrifying dirge for the dead. I shivered miserably, and it wasn't only from 
the cold. 

The horrifying crime scene reminded me of a bad time a few years back when we had 
found a little boy's body the day before Christmas. The image was everlasting in my 
mind. The boy's name was Michael Goldberg, but everybody had called him Shrimpie. 
He was only nine years old. The murderer's name was Gary Soneji, and he had escaped 
from prison after I caught him. 

He had escaped, and he had disappeared off the face of the earth. 

I'd come to think of Soneji as my Dr. Moriarty, evil incarnate, if there was such a thing, 
and I had begun to believe that there was. 

I couldn't help thinking and wondering about Soneji. Gary Soneji had a perfect reason to 
commit murders near my home. 

He had vowed to pay me back for his time spent in prison: every day, every hour, every 
minute. Payback time, Dr. Cross. 

As I ducked under the crisscrossing yellow crime-scene tapes, a woman in a white rain 
poncho yelled out to me, "You're supposed to be a policeman, right? So why the hell 
won't you do something! Do something about this maniac killing our children! 

Oh yeah, and have a happy, goddamn holiday!" 

What could I possibly say to the angry woman? That real police work wasn't like N.Y.P 

D. Blue on television? We had no leads on the two child killings so far. We had no 
Chop-It-Off-Chucky to blame anymore. There was no getting around a simple fact: 
Sampson and I had made a mistake. A bad hombre was dead, but probably for the wrong 
reason. 
The news coverage continued to be very limited, but I recognized a few reporters at the 
tragic scene: Inez Gomez from El Diario and Fern Galperin from CNN. They seemed to 
cover everything in Washington, occasionally even murders in Southeast. 

"Does this have anything to do with the child murder last week, Detective? Did you get 
the real murderer? Is this a serial killer of little kids?" Inez Gomez shot off a clipped 
barrage of questions at me. She was very good at her job, smart and tough and fair most 
of the time. 

I said nothing to any of the reporters, not even to Gomez. I didn't even look their way 
There was an ache at the center of my chest that wouldn't go away Is this a serial killer of 


little kids? I don't know, Inez. I think it might be. I pray that it isn't. Was Emmanuel 
Perez innocent? I don't believe so, Inez. I pray that he wasn't. 

Could Gary Soneji be the killerof these two children? I hope not. 

I pray that isn't the case, Inez. 

Lots of prayers this cold, dismal morning. 

It was too harsh for early December, too much snow. Somebody on the radio said 
they've been shoveling so much in D.C., it felt like an election year. 

I pushed my way through the crowd to the dead child lying like a broken doll on an 
expanse of frost-covered grass. The police photographer was taking pictures of the small 
boy He had a short haircut like Damon's, what Damon called a "baldie." 

Of course, I knew it wasn't Damon, but the effect was incredibly powerful. It was as if I 
had been punched in the stomach, hard. The sight took all the breath out of my chest and 
stomach, and left me wheezing. Cruelty isn't softened by tears. I had learned that lesson 
many times by then. 

I knelt down low over the murdered boy He looked as if he were sleeping, but having a 
terrible nightmare. Someone had closed his eyes, and I wondered if it could have been 
the killer. 

I didn't think so. More likely it was the work of some. Good Samaritan or possibly a 
good-hearted, but very careless, policeman. 

The little boy had on worn, loose gray sweats that had holes in the knees and tattered 
Nike sneakers. The right side of his face had been virtually destroyed by the killer blow, 
just like Shanelle's. The face was crushed, but also pocked with jagged holes and tears. 
Bright red blood was pooled under his head. 

The maniac likes to decimate beautiful things. It gave me an idea. Is the killer disfigured 
in some way himself? Physically? 

Emotionally ? Maybe both. 

Why does he hate small children so much? Why is he killing them near the Sojourner 
Truth School? 

I opened the little boy's eyes. The child stared up at me. I don't know why I did it. I just 
needed to look. 

"DR. CROSS... Dr. Cross... I know this boy," said a shaky voice. "He's in our lower 
school. His name is Vernon Wheatley." 


I looked up and saw Mrs. Johnson, the principal at Damon's school. She held back a 
sob; she grabbed the sob back hard. 

She's even tougher than you are, Daddy. That's what Damon had said to me. Maybe he 
was right about that. The school principal wouldn't cry, wouldn't allow herself to. 

The medical examiner was standing next to Mrs. Johnson. 

I knew her, too. She was a white woman, Janine Prestegard. 

Looked to be about the same age as Mrs. Johnson. Mid-thirties, give or take a few years. 
They had been talking, consulting, probably consoling each other. 

What was there about the Sojourner Truth School? Why this school? Why Damon 
school? Shanelle Green and now Vernon Wheatley. What did the principal know, if 
anything? Did the school principal believe she could help solve these terrifying murders? 
She had known both victims. 

The medical examiner was arranging for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. She 
looked shaken by the savage attack the child had suffered. The autopsy of a murdered 
child is as bad as it gets. 

Two detectives from the local precinct waited nearby. So did the morgue team. 
Everything was so quiet, so sad, so horribly bad, at the scene. There is nothing any worse 
than the murder of a child. Nothing I've seen, anyway. I remember every one that I've 
been to. Sampson sometimes tells me I'm too sensitive to be a homicide detective. I 
counter that every detective should be as sensitive and human as possible. 

I rose to my full height. At six three I was only a few inches taller than Mrs. Johnson. 

"You've been at both murder scenes," I said to her. "You live around here? You live 
nearby?" 

She shook her head. She looked straight up into my eyes. Her eyes were so intense, so 
large and round. They held mine and wouldn't let go. "I know a lot of people in the 
neighborhood. 

Someone called me at home. They felt I should know. I grew up near here in the Eastern 
Market section," she volunteered. "This is the same killer, isn't it?" 

I didn't answer her question. "I may need to talk to you about the murders later," I said. 
"We might have to talk to some of the children at school again. I won't do that unless we 
have to, though. They've been through enough. Thank you for your concern. I'm sorry 
about Vernon Wheatley." 


Mrs. Johnson nodded and kept looking at me with incredibly penetrating eyes. Who 
exactly are you? they seemed to ask. 

You've been at both murder scenes, too. 

"How can you do this kind of work?" she suddenly blurted out. 

It was an unexpected and startling question. It should have seemed tactless, but somehow 
it didn't. It happened to be my own personal mantra. How do you do this work, Alex? 
Why are you the dragonslayer? Who exactly are you? What have you become? 

"I don't really know." I told her the truth. 

Why had I admitted the weakness to her? I rarely did that with anyone, not even with 
Sampson. It had suffered. The autopsy of a murdered child is as bad as it gets.

"I don't really know." I told her the truth. 

Why had I admitted the weakness to her? I rarely did that with anyone, not even with 
Sampson. It was something about her eyes. They demanded the truth. 

I lowered my eyes and turned away from her. I had to. I went back to my note taking. 
My head was thick with questions, bad questions, bad thoughts, and worse feelings about 
the murder. 

The two murders. The two cases. 

Why does he hate children so much? I kept asking myself. Who could possibly hate 
these little children so much? He had to have been badly abused himself. Probably a 
male in his twenties. Not too organized or careful. 

I had the thought that we would catch this one -- but would we catch him soon enough? 

I WAS WAITING for possible disciplinary action from the department, waiting for the 
whisper of the ax. It didn't come right away Chief Pittman was holding his sharp knife 
over my head. 

The Jefe was playing with me. Cat and mouse. 

Maybe the higher powers wouldn't let him act... on account of Jack and Jill. That was it. 
It had to be. They felt that they needed me on the celebrity stalkings and murders. 

While I waited in limbo, there was plenty of work to do. I passed the hours checking and 
rechecking the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit data for anything that might possibly 
connect the two child murders to any others in Washington--or anywhere else, for that 
matter. Then I repeated almost the same process on Jack and Jill. If you want to 
understand the killer, look at his work. 

Jack and Jill were organized. The child killer was disorganized and sloppy The cases 
couldn't have been more different. 

I continued to feel that I couldn't work two complex homicide cases like these at the same 
time. I believed it was time for my so-called deal with the department to start working 
both ways. 

I made some phone calls late in the afternoon. I called in a few chips, favors I was owed 
inside the department. What did I have to lose? 


That night four homicide detectives from the 1st District met me in the deserted parking 
lot behind the Sojourner Truth School. pounds was a genuine badass in the department. 
All in all, four troublemakers. Four very good cops, though. Probably the best I knew in 
Washington. 

The detectives I'd chosen all lived right in Southeast. They each took the child murders 
personally and wanted the gruesome case solved quickly -- no matter what their other 
priority assignments were. 

Sampson was the last one to arrive, but he was only a few minutes past the ten o'clock 
starting time. The secret get-together would definitely have been shut down by the chief 
of detectives. 

I was about to set up an off-duty unit to help find the killer of Shanelle Green and Vernon 
Wheatley. We weren't vigilantes, but we were close. 

"The late John Sampson," Jerome Thurman quipped and let out a high-pitched laugh 
when Sampson finally entered the tight circle of homicide detectives. Thurman was close 
to two hundred seventy pounds, not much of it soft. He and Sampson liked to go at each 
other, but they were good friends. It had been that way since we all played roundball in 
the D.C. high school leagues a thousand or so years ago. 

"My watch says ten on the dot,,' Sampson said, without peeking at his ancient Bulova. 

"Then ten o'clock it is," contributed Shawn Moore. Moore was a hard-driving, young 
detective with three kids of his own. His family lived less than a mile from the Truth 
School, as it's usually called in the neighborhood. One of his boys went there with 
Damon. 

"I'm glad you all could come out to play on this chilly night," I said after the ribbing and 
small talk had settled down. I knew that these detectives got along and had respect for 
one another. I also knew this meeting would never get back to TheJefe through any of 
them. 

"Sorry to get you out here so late. Best we don't be seen together. 

Thanks for coming, though. This school yard seemed like the right place for what we 
have to talk about. I'll make it as short as possible," I said, looking around at all the 
faces. 

"You'd better, Alex," Jerome warned me. "Freezin' my fat ass off." 

"You've all heard about the Seven-year-old boy found in Garfield Park this morning?" I 
asked the detectives. "Boy by the name of Vernon Wheatley." 

Heads nodded solemnly around the circle. Bad homicide news always travels quickly. 


"Well, I've been thinking about these child murders a lot. 

I've run the evidence we have through the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program and 
also the Behavioral Science Unit databanks. Nothing comes up that's a match. I have a 
preliminary psych profile working. I hope that I'm wrong, but I'm afraid there's a pattern 
killer working in this neighborhood. This is probably a serial killer of children. I'm 
almost sure of it." 

"How bad a situation are we talking, Alex?" Rakeem Powell leaned in and asked me. 

I knew what Rakeem was getting at. He and I had worked on a tough pattern-killer case 
a few years back. "I think this one is already in heat, Rakeem. The two murders came 
within days. There was a high level of violence. He seems to be in a rage, or damn close 
to it. I say he, though it might be a she." 

"Violent for a female," Sampson said. He cleared his throat. 

"Too much... blood... crushed skulls... little kids." He shook his head no. "Doesn't feel 
like a woman to me." 

"I tend to agree," I said, "but you never know these days. Look at Jill." 

"How many detectives assigned to the child murders? "Jerome Thurman asked through 
thick lips that were pursed and stuck way out from his face, like those candy lips kids 
wear and then eat when they tire of having fat lips. 

"Two teams." I told them the bad news. "Only one is full-time, though. That's the reason 
I wanted us to meet. The chief of detectives is resisting any theory that the same person 
killed both children. Emmanuel Perez is stilll on the books as the killer of the girl." 

"That dumb motherfuck asshole," Jerome Thurman growled angrily. "That bastard's as 
useless as titties on a bull." 

The other detectives cursed and grumbled. I had expected a negative reaction to anything 
The Jefe said or did. Still, I wasn't into cheap shots. Much as I was tempted. 

"How sure are you about this being the same killer, Alex?" Rakeem asked. "You said 
your profile is preliminary. I know this shit takes time." 

I sniffed in the cold, then went on. "The second child, the little boy, had his face badly 
smashed in, Rakeem. Only one side of the face, though. It was exactly like the murdered 
little girl's face. Same side, the right. No significant variation that I could find. The 
medical examiner corroborates that. The "unsub" probably feels that he has a good and a 
bad side. The bad side gets punished--destroyed, is more like it. 


"The final thing, and this is just a best guess at this point, I think he's a beginner at this. 
But devious and clever just the same... a risk taker. He'll make a mistake. I think we can 
get him soon, if we work together. But it has to be soon. I think we can nail this one!" 

Sampson finally spoke up. "You going to talk about what's really going down here, Alex, 
or you want me to?" 

I smiled at what Sampson had said, the cranky way he'd said it. "No, I thought I'd leave 
the real dirty work to you." 

"As usual," he said. "Here's what Alex hasn't said so far. Just to get it out on the dance 
floor. The real reason one team of detectives is assigned to these murders goes 
something like this. 

One, it happened in the area of the projects, and we know all the shit flows downhill in 

D.C. and eventually ends up here. Two, Jack and Jill is sucking up everybody's time in 
the department. 
Rich white people are being killed. They're scared shitless up on Capitol Hill and such. 
So of course we drop everything else. Two little black kids don't matter much, not in the 
greater scheme, not in the big picture." 

"Sampson and I have been working on the Truth School murders." 

I picked up his thread, just lowered the volume a touch. 

"Strictly off the books. We have to do our own surveillance," I added, so that everybody 
knew the deal. "We need some help now. This is a major homicide case. Unfortunately, 
there are two major cases in Washington at this time." 

"Only one case on my mind," Rakeem Powell said. "One guess which case it is." 

"You know you've got the Fatman on board." Jerome Thurman raised his high-pitched 
voice and punched his stubby club of an arm into the air. "I'm in. I'm on your nonpayroll 
with all its nonbenefits and risks for forced early retirement. Sounds great." 

"My boy goes to the Sojourner Truth School, Alex," Shawn Moore said. "I'll make the 
time for this. Hope I can fit in Jack and Jill." 

We laughed at the jokes. It was our hardass approach to the difficult problems at hand. 
The five of us were in. We just didn't have any idea what we were in for. 

There were definitely two major murder cases in Washington and now there were two 
task forces to try and solve them. One and a half task forces, anyway. 


"Cocktails, anyone?" Jerome Thurman asked in the softest, most cultivated voice. You'd 
have thought we were at the old Cotton Club in Harlem as he passed around his beat-up 
Washington Redskins game flask. 

We all took a hit; more like two or three. 

We were blood brothers. 

I WORKED the Jack and Jill case from five in the morning until three o'clock in the 
afternoon. Me and about ten thousand other harried law officers around D.C. I was 
checking for a possible link between Senator Fitzpatrick and Natalie Sheehan. We even 
looked at news photos taken of them in the past months. 

Maybe somebody interesting would show up in the background of a shot. Or even better, 
show up twice. I had a detective visiting all of the kinky sex shops around D.C. He 
called the assignment the ultimate Jack-off. 

I met Sampson at the Boston Market restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue at three-thirty It 
was time for our second job. Our other homicide case, the "back burner" case. This 
arrangement was definitely much better -- not great, but a significant improvement over 
the past few days of frustration and utter madness for me. 

"I think you might be right on the button about one thing, Alex," Sampson told me over a 
lunch of double-glazed meat loaf and mashed potatoes made from scratch. "The Truth 
School killer is an amateur. He's sloppy Maybe a first-timer at this. He left prints all over 
the second crime scene, too. The techies got his prints, some hair, threads off his 
clothing. Based on the prints, the killer is a small man -- or possibly a woman. If this 
squirrel isn't careful, he or she is going to get their squirrel ass caught." 

"Maybe the killer wants to," I said between bites of a meat loaf sandwich spiced with 
decent tomato sauce. "Or maybe the killer just wants us to think he's a first-timer. That 
could be the act. Someone might play it like that." 

Sampson grinned broadly It was his best killer smile. "Do you have to double- and triple-
think everything, Sugar?" 

"Of course I do. That's my job description. That's Alex's cross," I said and offered my 
own killer smile. 

"Oh, ho !" said Man Mountain and grinned again. Man, I loved being with him, loved to 
make him laugh. 

"Anything in from the rest of the team?" I asked him. "Jerome? 

Rakeem?" 


"They're all working the case, but still no tangible results. 

Nothing yet from the go-team." 

"We need surveillance at the boy's funeral and at Shanelle's gravesite. The killer might 
not be able to stay away A lot of them can't." 

Sampson rolled his eyes. "We'll do what we can. Do our best. 

Surveillance at a child's gravesite. Shee-it." 

At quarter past four, the two of us split. I headed over to the Sojourner Truth School. 

The principal's car was sitting in the small, fenced-in parking lot. I remembered that Mrs. 
Johnson sometimes worked late after classes. That was good for me. I wanted to talk to 
her about Shanelie Green and Vernon Wheatley What connection was there between the 
Truth School and the killer? What could it be? 

I knew approximately where the principal's office was located in the annexed building, so 
I walked directly there. It was a very nice school, for just about any area of the city 
Outside, near the street, a chain-link fence with razor wire ran the perimeter of the school 
yard, but the inside was festive, very bright, imaginatively decorated. 

I read several hand-lettered posters and banners as I walked. 

CHILDREN FIRST. GROW WHERE YOU ARE PLANTED. SUCCESS COMES IN 
CANS, Comball, but nice. Inspiring for the children, and for me as well. 

That particular week the hallway display cases were filled with "animal shelters," which 
were made by the kids, each one illustrating an animal and its habitat. It struck me that 
the Sojoumer Truth School was a terrific habitat itself. Under normal circumstances, it 
was a sweet place for Damon to grow and learn. 

Unfortunately, two little babies from this school had been murdered in the last week. 

That made me furiously angry, and it also frightened me more than I wanted to admit. 
When I was growing up, tough as it was supposed to have been in D.C., kids seldom if 
ever died at our school. Now, for a lot of reasons, it happened all the time in schools. 
Not only in Washington but in L.A."s schools. New York's. Chicago's. Maybe even 
Sioux City's. 

What the hell was going on from sea to shining sea? 

The heavy wooden door to the inner administrative office was open, but the assistant 
appeared to have left. On her desk was a collection of Caucasian, African-American, and 
Asian play dolls. 


A sign read: Barbara Breckenridge, I can really tap-dance. 

I felt like a housebreaker, a neighborhood break-and-enter artist', a bad character of some 
sort or other. Suddenly, I was concerned about the principal working late by herself in 
the school. 

Anyone could walk in here, just as I had done. The Sojoumer Truth School killer could 
walk in here some night. It would be so easy This easy. 

I turned the corner into the main office and was about to announce my presence when I 
saw Mrs. Johnson. I thought of my made-up name for her -- Christine. 

She was busy at work at an old-fashioned rolltop desk that looked at least a hundred years 
old. She was lost in the work, actually I watched her for a couple of seconds. She wore 
gold-wire glasses to do her paperwork. She was humming the "Shoop Shoop" song from 
Waiting to Exhale. Sounded nice. 

There was something enormously right, even touching, about the scene -- the dedicated 
teacher, the educator, at work. A smile passed across my lips. She's even tougher than 
you are, Daddy. 

I still wondered about that. She didn't look tough at the moment. 

She looked serene, happy in her work. She looked at peace, and I envied her that. 

I finally felt a little awkward standing in the doorway unannounced. 

"Hi there. It's Detective Alex Cross," I said. "Hello. 

Mrs. Johnson?" 

She stopped humming and looked up. There was the slightest glint of fear in her eyes. 
Then she smiled. Her smile was warm and welcoming. Very nice to be on the receiving 
end of one of her easy smiles. 

"Ahh, it is Detective Cross," she said. "And what brings you to the principal's office?" 
she said in a put-on voice of authority 

"I guess I need some help from the principal. Extra help with my homework." That was 
true enough, I suppose. "I need to talk with you a little about Vernon Wheatley, if that's 
possible. 

I also wanted to get your okay to speak with some of the teachers again, to see if any of 
them heard anything from the kids after Vernon's murder. Somebody might have seen 


something that would help us, even if they don't think they did. Maybe something the 
kids heard their parents say" 

"Yes, I figured the same thing," Mrs. Johnson said. "Somebody here at the school could 
have a clue, something useful, and might not know it." 

I liked everything I saw about Mrs. Johnson, but as soon as I saw it, I pushed it out of my 
mind. Wrong time, wrong place, and wrong woman. I'd done some questionable things 
in my life, and I'm no angel, but trying to fool with a married woman wasn't going to be 
one of them. 

"There's not too much new to report, I'm afraid," she said. 

"I've been working a little overtime on your account. I grilled the teachers at lunch today. 
Interrogated them, actually. I told them that they should tell me if they heard or saw 
anything suspicious. 

They talk to me about most things. We have a pretty close-knit group here." 

"Are any of the teachers still here? I could talk to them now if they are. I don't know this 
for sure, but I suspect the killer might have watched the school at some point," I said to 
her. I didn't want to frighten Mrs. Johnson or the other teachers, but I did want them on 
the alert and cautious. I believed that the killer probably had scouted the school. 

She shook her head slowly back and forth. Then she cocked it softly to the left. She 
seemed to be looking at me in a new way. 

"Almost all of them are long gone by four. They like to leave together, if possible. 
Safety in numbers." 

"That makes a lot of sense to me. It isn't a great neighborhood. 

Well, it is and it isn't." 

"And being here at five or so, with a lot of unlocked doors, doesn't make any kind of 
sense," she said. It was what I had been thinking ever since I arrived at her office door. 

I didn't say anything, didn't comment on the unlocked doors. 

Mrs. Johnson was certainly free to live her life in whatever way she chose. "Thanks for 
checking with the teachers for us," I said to her. "Thanks for the overtime work." 

"No, thank you for coming by," she said. "I'm sure this must be very hard for you and for 
Damon. For your whole family It certainly is for all of us at the school." 


She finally took off the wire-rim glasses and slid them into the pocket of her work smock. 
She looked good with or without glasses. 
Intelligent, nice, pretty. 
Off-limits, out-of-bounds, off your radar charts, I reminded myself. 


I could almost feel a ruler rap across my knuckles. 
Faster than I would have thought possible, she slid a snubnose.38 Special out of an open 
drawer on the right side of the desk. 


She didn't point it in my direction, but she easily could have. 
Easily. 
"I lived in this neighborhood for a lot of years," she explained. 
Then she smiled and put the gun away. "I try to be prepared for whatever might happen," 


she said calmly "And shit does happen around here. I knew you were there in the 
doorway, Detective. 

The kids claim I have eyes in the back of my head. Actually, I do." 
She laughed again. I did like her laugh. Anyone with a pulse would. Say goodnight, 
Alex. 


I had mixed feelings about civilians owning guns, but I was sure hers was registered and 


legal. "You learn to use that revolver in the neighborhood?" I asked. 
"No, actually, I learned at the Remington Gun Club out in Fairfax. My husband was, is, 
worried about my coming to work here, too. You men seem to think alike. Sorry, sorry," 
she said and smiled again. "I try to catch myself when even I say outrageous sexist 
things like that. I don't like that. No how, no way Sorry." 


She stood up and flicked off the Mac laptop on her desk. "I'll walk you to the front 


door," she said. "Make sure you get out safely, since it's well after four." 
"That's a good idea." I went along with her little joke. She had me smiling some, anyway 
That was pretty good, under the circumstances of the past few days. "Are you always 
this funny? 


This loose?" 
She work." 


"No, thank you for coming by," she said. "I'm sure this must be very hard for you and for 


Damon. For your whole family It certainly is for all of us at the school." 
She finally took off the wire-rim glasses and slid them into the pocket of her work smock.

That was pretty good, under the circumstances of the past few days. "Are you always 
this funny? 


This loose?" 



She tilted her head again. It was something she did often. Then she nodded confidently. 
"Always. At least this funny Those were my two vocational choices: comedienne or 
educator. Obviously, I chose comedienne. More laughs here. Honest laughs. Most 
days, anyway" 

The two of us walked down the deserted halls of the school together. Our footfalls made 
clapping sounds that echoed loudly The "Shoop Shoop" song played inside my head, the 
tune she'd been humming in her office. There were lots more questions I wanted to ask 
her, but I knew I shouldn't be asking some of them. 

They had nothing to do with the murder case. 

When we got to the school's front door, a husky, middle-aged security guard was there to 
let me out. He surprised me. I hadn't seen him on my way in. 

He had a thick wooden nightstick and a walkie-talkie. It was the look and feel of D.C. 
schools that I knew all too well. 

Guards, metal detectors, steel-mesh screens covering every window. 

No wonder the people of the neighborhood hate and fear all established institutions, even 
their own schools. 

"Goodnight, sir," the school guard said with a most congenial smile. "You be leaving 
soon, Mrs. Johnson?" 

"Pretty soon," she said. "You can go home if you want to, Lionel. I have my Uzi inside." 

Lionel laughed at her joke. She had very good delivery, good timing. I'll bet she could 
have done some stand-up work if she'd wanted. 

"Goodnight, Mrs. Johnson," I said. I couldn't help adding, "Please be careful until this 
case is over." 

She stood just inside the heavy wooden door. She looked so wise, and she was attractive, 
in my way of viewing the world. "It's 'Christine,'" she said, "and I will be careful. I 
promise. Thank you for stopping by." 

Christine! Jesus! It was the same name I'd made up for her. 

Probably I'd heard it somewhere before, from Damon or Nana, but it seemed so strange. 
Kind of magical, actually. Would have made James Redfield happy as hell. 


I went home that evening thinking about the two child murders, and Jack and Jill, but also 
about the principal of the Sojourner Truth School. She was wise, funny, and pretty, too. 
She could take care of herself-- even handle a gun. 

Mrs. Johnson. 

Christine. 

Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. 

IN THIS DANGEROUS AGE, everybody needs to think, It won't happen to me. Not to 
me. What are the odds of it actually happening to me? 

The motion picture actor Michael Robinson thought it was absurd and more than a little 
self-absorbed for him to be concerned or afraid of the maniac killers on the loose in 
Washington. 

What did the malicious Jack and Jill threats have to do with him, anyway? The answer, it 
seemed clear to him, was nothing at all. 

Still, he was a trifle skittish and jumpy, so he tried to enjoy the adrenaline rush, to go 
with the nasty flow of the moment, of the times we live in. 

A little before midnight, the Hollywood star finally got up his nerve and called for a date 
from the VIP escort service. A "snack" before bedtime. He had used the service many 
times before while visiting D.C. The discreet, toney, very expensive sex-for-hire service 
had his requirements down pat. M.R. was in its file, compliments of the star's full-
service business agent in Los Angeles. 

After he made the phone call, the forty-nine-year-old actor tried to read an expensive 
adventure-romance script he'd commissioned, but then got up and walked to the window 
of his penthouse suite at the Willard Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. 

He knew his fans would find it scandalous that he was paying for a lover, but that was 
their hang-up, not his. 

The truth was, he found it far less complicated, and far easier on the psyche, to pay a 
thousand or fifteen hundred than to get involved in wooing, and then painfully separating 
from, lovers while on the road. 

Actually, he was in a good mood tonight, feeling very level and grounded, he thought as 
he stared out on the street. He just needed some company, a little TLC, and some 
uncomplicated sex. All three of his requirements would be met shortly, he hoped. 

In a way, he was still time-warped back in his hometown of Wichita, circa 1963, when he 
was a high school senior. The fantasies and desires he'd had then were still unresolved 


and operating full-tilt boogie inside him. There was one difference: he knew what he 
wanted tonight and he would get it without much trouble, guilt, or the gnashing of teeth. 

He glanced around the hotel suite and decided to tidy it up before the escort arrived. The 
neurotic tidying-up made him smile. 

How incredibly bourgeois he still was. You can take the boy out of Kansas, Michael 
Robinson thought. 

He heard two quick raps on the door, and the noise caught him by surprise. The service 
had said the escort would be there within the hour, which usually meant at least that long, 
sometimes longer. 

"Just a minute," he called out. "Be right there. One minute." 

Michael Robinson glanced at his watch. The "date" had arrived in about thirty minutes. 
Well, fine. He was ready for some quick nookie and then a night of blessed sleep. He 
was having breakfast with the chairman of the Democratic National Committee early the 
next morning. He'd been asked to do a fund-raiser for the Democrats. The chairman was 
a starfucker of another variety They all were, really Everybody wanted what he thought 
he couldn't have, and everybody couldn't have Michael Robinson. Well, almost 
everybody He peeked through the hotel-door spyhole. Well, well, well. 

He definitely liked what he saw in the hallway; even through a fish-eye lens, the escort 
looked good. He felt a spike of adrenaline kick in. He opened the door and his fifteen-
million-dollar-per-picture smile was automatically engaged. 

"Hi, I'm Jasper," the handsome escort said. "It's very nice to meet you, sir." 

Michael Robinson doubted that the escort was "Jasper." He thought that a name like Jake 
or Cliff would fit the escort better. 

He was a tad older than Robinson had expected, possibly in his mid-thirties, but he was 
more than acceptable. He was near perfect, actually. Michael Robinson was already 
hard, and he was lubricated. Armed and dangerous, he called the ready state. 

"How are you doing tonight?" The actor put out his hand and lightly touched the other 
man's arm. He wanted "Jasper" to know that he was down-to-earth, unaffected, and most 
of all, a warm person. He truly was all of that. USA Today had recently published a list 
of the "nicest" stars in Hollywood. He was on it, courtesy of his business agent and 
lawyer, who spoke exceedingly well of him. 

Jack unleashed his best smile as he entered Michael Robinson's Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous hotel suite. He shut the door behind him. He figured he had about half an hour 
before the real escort arrived from the service. That would be enough time. 


At any rate, Jill was watching the lobby of the Willard, just in case the male prostitute 
arrived early. She would take care of things downstairs. Jill was excellent with the 
details, all the loose ends. Jill was excellent, period. 

"I'm a real fan," Jack said to the big Hollywood star. "I've been following your career 
closely, actually" 

Michael Robinson spoke in a near-whisper that would have shocked male and female 
fans of his action-romance films. "Oh, really, Jasper? That's always so nice for me to 
hear. It's kind of you to say, anyway" 

"I swear to God, it's true." Sam Harrison continued his act. 

"My name is Jack, by the way Jill is down in the lobby Maybe you've heard of us?" 

Jack pulled out a Beretta with a silencer and aimed it between the actor's startled deep-
blue eyes. He fired. It fit the pattern of Jack and Jill. People in high places. Execution-
style murder. 

Kinky touches and poem to follow. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill To kill, to kill, to kill. 

ONE SPECIFIC, and particularly fascinating, detail about the murders was weighing 
heavily on my mind, troubling the hell out of me. I thought about it as I turned onto 
crowded Pennsylvania Avenue and double-parked in front of the Willard Hotel -- the 
latest helter-skelter murder scene. 

I thought about the troubling detail as I marched inside and headed up to Michael 
Robinson's suite. 

I thought about it as the smooth-riding elevator whooshed open on the seventh floor, 
where half a dozen uniforms were standing around, and rolls of crime-scene tape 
ribboned the hallway like a tangle of distasteful Christmas wrapping. 

There wasn't much evidence of passion in the first two killings, I was thinking. 
Especially the second murder. The murders were so cold-blooded and efficient. The 
arrangement of the bodies of the victims seemed to have been art-directed. The kinkiness 
of the scenes seemed too directed and orderly. This is the exact opposite of the Sojourner 
Truth School murders, which were violent explosions of pent-up anger and pure rage. 

I didn't get the full significance yet, and neither did anyone else I spoke to about the 
murder case. Not inside the D.C. police, and not at the Federal Bureau in Quantico. If, 
as a detective, I had one basic rule about premeditated murders, it was this: they were 
almost always based on passion. There usually had to be extreme love. Or hate. Or 
greed... but these killings seemed to have none of that. It kept bugging me. 


Why Michael Robinson ? I wondered as I walked toward the hotel room where he had 
been murdered. What are these two bizarre psychopaths doing here in Washington? 
What sick and cruel game are they playing... and why do they crave millions of spectators 
for their sensational blood sport? 

I spotted Kyle Craig once again. The FBI senior agent and I talked for several moments 
outside the suite. All around us, usually sangfroid D.C. cops appeared in mild shock. A 
lot of them were probably disappointed Michael Robinson fans. 

"The medical examiner figures he's been a famous corpse for about seven hours. So it 
happened around twelve last night," Kyle told me, giving me the lay of the land. "Two 
shots fired to his head, Alex. Close range, just like the others. Take a look at the 
tattooing for yourself. Whoever did the shooting is a real heartless bastard." 

I agreed with what Kyle was saying. 

Heartless. 

No passion. 

No rage. 

"How was Michael Robinson found?" 

"Oh, that's another good part, Alex. A new wrinkle. They phoned it in to the Post. Told 
the newspaper where to pick up the trash this morning." 

"Is that a quote?" I asked Kyle. 

"I don't have the exact quote they used, but 'pick up the trash' was definitely part of it," 
Kyle said. 

I was interested in any irreverence or cynicism Jack and Jill might use in describing the 
killings. They were obviously into wordplay They were artistes. I also wondered if they 
might be out there on Pennsylvania Avenue, watching us again. Filming us as we 
bumbled and stumbled over one another inside the Willard. I wondered if they were 
preparing a second film, with their usual wide-release distribution method in mind. 
Surveillance had been posted outside, so if they were there, we had then. 

I entered the living room of the suite, and I was relieved to see that Chief of Detectives 
Pittman was nowhere on the scene. The film actor Michael Robinson was there, 
however. As they say, he had been born to play the role -- Perhaps his greatest. 


His naked body was in a sitting position on the floor, the head against the couch. It 
seemed as if the actor had been propped up to see anyone entering the room, and maybe 
that was the killers' idea. His eyes stared out at me. To see, or to be seen? I wondered. 

He was not a pretty sight. took note of the lividity The blood had already pooled in the 
lowermost parts of his body, which now had an ugly purplish red color. 

Another celebrity had been exposed. Brought down to earth. 

Punished for some real or imagined sin ? What connection was there with Fitzpatrick 
and Sheehan? Why a senator, a newswoman, and an actor? 

Three murders in such a short time. Celebrities are supposed to be safer than the rest of 
us, more protected at least, and above all this. It got to me, seeing Michael Robinson dead 
and violated. 

There was something visceral and system-shocking about what the killers were doing. 

What was the bizarre, complex message from Jack and Jill? 

That nobody was safe anymore? I rolled the outrageous thought around in my head. It 
was a good starting place, a concept to work with. 

Nobody is safe?Jack and Jill were telling us they could come for anyone, at any time. 
They knew how to get inside. 

There was another note with the body Another Jack and Jill rhyme. It was on the night 
table, where the weird and ghoulish killers, or killer, had left it for us to find. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill To do some deadly deeds. 

They weren't far wrong To judge how long A bleeding liberal bleeds. 

One of Michael Robinson's agents was in the room. He'd flown down from New York. 
He was a good-looking man, with silver-blond hair. He wore a long cashmere coat over 
an Armani suit. I noticed his eyes were red and swollen. He seemed to have been crying. 
Two medical examiners were working on the film actor's body I suppose you could call 
all that attention going out in style. 

Only the best for Michael Robinson. 

There were some other obvious connections to the Fitzpatrick and Sheehan murders. 
There was a tawdry, kinky side to all three killings. Each had been an execution. And 
maybe most important so far, they were all "bleeding liberals," weren't they? They had 
all been exposed for what they were. 


"Dr. Alex Cross ? Excuse me, you're Dr. Alex Cross, aren't you ?" 
I turned to a tall, rangy man who had spoken my name. He was clean-cut and his bearing 


was almost military. About forty, I guessed. He wore a black raincoat over a dark gray 
suit. A buttoned-down look. Definitely senior law enforcement of some kind, I figured. 
"Yes, I'm Alex Cross," I said to him. 
"I'm Jay Grayer from the Secret Service," he introduced himself formally There was 


something about the very erect way that he held himself. Extreme confidence. Or was it 
moral certitude? A stiff pole up his behind? 


"I'm senior agent of the First Family detail." 
"What can I do for you?" I asked Agent Grayer. Alarms were already sounding in my 
head. I felt I was about to get a much fuller understanding of why I had been put on the 
Jack and Jill investigation. By whom, and for exactly what reason. 


"You're wanted at the White House," he said. "I'm afraid it's a command performance, 
Dr. Cross. It's about the Jack and Jill investigation. There's a problem we have to let you 
know about." 


"I'll bet it's a big problem, too," I said to Agent Grayer. 


"Yes, I'm afraid it is. It's a very big problem, Dr. Cross. We have something we need to 
share with you." 
I had suspected as much. I'd had a quiet fear way in the back of my mind. Now it was up 


front. 
I was being summoned to the White House. 
They wanted the dragonslayer there. Did they understand what that meant? 
THE ONLY THING anybody seems to share very readily in Washington these days is 


trouble. 
I could hardly argue with the command from on high, though. 
I dutifully accompanied Jay Grayer up the street to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Ask not 


what I can do for my country. 
The White House was only a short jaunt from the Willard Hotel. 
Despite the relative performance of some of the recent occupants, the White House 


continues to cast its spell over a lot of people, including me. I had been inside only 



twice, on canned guided tours with my kids, but even they had been larger-than-life and 
moving. I almost wished Damon and Jannie could be with me. 

We were quickly passed through the blue-canopied guardhouse on West Executive Drive. 
Agent Grayer was allowed to park his car in the garage under the White House. He 
seemed modestly proud of the perk. He explained that the garage was still considered a 
primary bomb shelter, but also an escape route in case of an attack. 

"Good to know," I said and smiled. Grayer smiled back. It was forced conviviality, but 
at least we were both making an effort. 

"I'm sure you're curious as to why you've been asked to come. 

I would be." 

"I don't think I've been invited to tea," I said stiffly. "But, yes, I'm very curious." 

"The reason is the Soneji and Casanova cases," Grayer explained to me as we took an 
elevator one flight up from the garage. 

"Your reputation precedes you here. You're aware that the FBI has never captured a 
single serial killer, for all their expertise? 

We want you on the tean:." 

"What team is that?" I asked. 

"You'll see in a few seconds. This is definitely the A team, though. Be ready for some 
crazy shit. The Bureau has staked out the hotel room where John Hinckley stayed. Just 
in case the killers might decide to stay there. Pay homage, or something like that." 

"Not such a terrible idea," I told Grayer. He looked at me as if I were crazy, too. "Not a 
particularly good idea, either," I said. He cracked a grin. 

Half a dozen men and two women in business attire were gathered in the West Wing 
office of the White House chief of staff. I sensed a lot of tension in the room, but 
everyone was working hard to hide it. I was introduced as the representative of the 
Washington police. Welcome to the team. Say hello to the dragonslayer. 

The others at the table cordially introduced themselves. Two more senior agents from the 
Secret Service, a woman named Ann Roper and a youngish, good-looking man named 
Michael Fescoe; the director of intelligence from the FBI, Robert Hatfield; General 
Aiden Cornwall from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. Army; the national security 
advisor, Michael Kane; the White House chief of staff, Don Hamerman. The other 
woman turned out to be a senior officer in the CIA. The inspector general. 


Her name was Jeanne Sterling. Her presence meant that a foreign power's involvement in 
Jack and Jill was being considered. There was a twist I hadn't considered before. 

It was fast company for a homicide detective from SoutheaSt D.C., even for a deputy 
chief. But I figured I was pretty fast company, too. I had seen nasty things that none of 
them had, or would ever want to. 

Let the sharing begin. 

Glistening sweet rolls, butter in ice, and coffee in silver pots had been put out for our 
unusual breakfast club. It was obvious that some of the others had worked together 
before. I had learned a long time ago that if you can't spot the pigeon in a poker game, 
then you're probably it. 

The national security advisor called the gathering to order a minute or so past ten. Don 
Hamerman was a wiry, blond man in his mid-thirties who appeared to be tightly strung. 
That definitely fit the White House staff profile in recent years: very young and very 
uptight. On the move. On the make, get set, go. 

"I'm going to use overheads for this presentation, folks. That's the way we do it here in 
the Big House," Hamerman said and managed a thin, forced smile. He had an unsettling 
kinetic energy. 

He reminded me of high-flying D.C. public relations types, and even of Michael 
Robinson's overwrought agent back at the Willard. 

I gathered from his remark that White House meetings were usually bureaucratic and 
somewhat formal, rather than loosy-goosy. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy the small joke, anyway. 

Actually, the forced cordiality disturbed me. I was still flashing On the death-mask 
expression of Michael Rob Michael Fescoe; the director of intelligence from the FBI, 
Robert Hatfield; General Aiden Cornwall from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. 
Army; the national security advisor, Michael Kane; the White House chief of staff, Don 
Hamerman. The other woman turned out to be a senior officer in the CIA. The inspector 
general.

Actually, the forced cordiality disturbed me. I was still flashing On the death-mask 
expression of Michael Robinson. It wasn't an image I liked bringing with me into the 
White House. 

Michael Robinson's naked corpse was probably still in the Willard Hotel with the morgue 
team, ready to be tagged and bagged. 

"I have about an hour's worth of briefing material -- tops. 

With full discussion, let's say we're at two hours," Hamerman continued. "That will take 
us close to noon, but I believe the unfortunate circumstances warrant a tight briefing up 
front." 

What unfortunate circumstances, exactly ? I wanted to interrupt Hamerman, but I kept 
my cool. It was neither the time nor the place. 

Cups of coffee and several cigarette packs were already laid out on the worktable. 
Everyone was prepared for a tough siege. 

I guessed that was the way it was done at the Big House. 

Hamerman placed his first overhead on the gently purring machine. The display screen 
said Jack and Jill Investigation. 


Not much to argue about so far. 

"As you know, there have been three brutal celebrity murders in Washington in the past 
week. The latest was the shooting sometime last night of the actor Michael Robinson at 
the Willard. 

The stalkers call themselves Jack and Jill. They leave artsy mash notes at their murder 
scenes. They like to play games with the media. They seem to relish the spotlight a lot. 

"They also seem to know what they're doing. They've successfully committed three high-
profile murders and haven't left us squat to work with. They appear to be signature or 
serial killers, though of a particularly high order. That's debatable, or so I'm led to 
understand. But it's one theory. 

"Here's the first kicker," Hamerman said and arched his thin, blond eyebrows. "What 
some of you don't know is that Jack and Jill' is also the Secret Service code name used for 
President and Mrs. Byrnes. It has been since the President took office. We are not 
comfortable accepting this fact as mere coincidence." 

The blond woman from the CIA lit a cigarette. I remembered her name. Jeanne Sterling. 
She blew out a pale gust of smoke. 

I heard her mutter "shit." My sentiments exactly. This was the worst news we'd had so 
far. Also, I didn't appreciate the fact it had been kept from us until this moment. 

"We believe it is a very real possibility that an assassination attempt could be made on 
either President Byrnes or Mrs. Byrnes. 

Or perhaps on both of them," Hamerman said. 

The words were absolutely chilling to hear. I glanced around the table and saw the 
frozen expressions of concern. 

"We have taken, or are taking, every precaution that we can think of. The President's 
exposure outside the White House will be extremely limited for the time being. He's 
been told everything about the unfortunate situation, and so has Mrs. Byrnes. They're 
taking it well. They're both very smart, very impressive people. 

They will not panic. I can promise you that. I'll do the panicking for both of them. 

"Let me talk about some facts we don't have about the so-called stalkers Jack and Jill. 
Actually, there are several thousand investigators assigned to the case, and we know 
surprisingly little. Jack and Jill may be heading toward the White House next, and we 
don't have the foggiest idea why. Or who they might be. Or what the hell is in this for 
them." 


Don Hamerman peered around the table. He was definitely wired. The other word to 
describe him, the one that came to my mind anyway, was supercilious. 

"Please feel free to correct me on any point I make. Feel free to add any updated 
information you might have," he said with a tiny sneer. 

Except for a few sighs, no one spoke. No one seemed to know any more than I did. No 
one had a worthwhile clue so far. That was the scariest thing of all. 

The possibility existed that the President and First Lady were the ultimate targets for Jack 
and Jill... or maybe not even the ultimate targets? 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill. What in the name of God for? 

To wipe out all the bleeding liberals? To punish sinners? Was the President a sinner in 
their minds ? 

"Jay, do you want to say something now?" Hamerman asked Secret Service Agent 
Grayer. 

Grayer nodded and stood up at the worktable. He leaned against it with his hands. He 
looked a little pale. "There's a very tough problem here," he said to us. "The danger is 
real, believe me. This is as scary as anything I've seen in my time at the White House. 
You see, I was the first one inside Senator Fitzpatrick's apartment after the killing. I was 
there, alone, at six o'clock that morning. I called the Metro police... the same is true for 
Ms. Sheehan and for Michael Robinson. Each time Jack and Jill has called the Secret 
Service first. They've contacted us right here at the White House. They told us... that 
they're practicing for the big one." 

ON FRIDAY NIGHT Jack and Jill checked into a high-priced suite at the Four Seasons 
Hotel, one of the Washington area's best. No one was scheduled to die at the exclusive 
hotel. Not that they knew of, anyway. Actually, the killers were taking the weekend off-- 
while everyone else in Washington, the police geniuses especially, stewed in their own 
juices. 

What a fabulous treat the weekend was. What a delicious notion. 

The six-hundred-dollar-a-night suite overlooked a corner of Georgetown, and they never 
left it for a moment. A masseuse came Friday night for a double shiatsu session. Sara 
had a facial and a manicure on Saturday morning. Room service sent up a personal chef 
Saturday night, and he prepared their meal in their room. Sam had also provided for four 
dozen white roses to be delivered when they arrived. It was paradise regained. They felt 
they deserved it for what they had accomplished so far. 


"This is so unbelievably decadent. It's a postmodern, grossly socially incorrect fairy 
tale," Sara said at a luxurious high point late on Sunday night. "I love every minute of 
it." 

"But do you love every inch of it?" Sam asked her. Only he could get away with a 
touchy line like that -- and he did. 

Sara smiled and felt a rush of heat inside her body. She looked at him with warm and 
inquiring eyes. "As a matter of fact, I do." 

He was deep inside her, thrusting slowly and gently, and she was wondering if he truly 
loved her. She wished for it with all her being, but she didn't believe it, couldn't believe 
it. She was, after all, Sara the gimp, Sara the drudge, Sara the drone. 

How could he have fallen in love with her? And yet sometimes it seemed that he had. Is 
this part of the game for him, too? Sara wondered. 

Her fingers ran all over his chest, played with individual hairs. 

She touched him everywhere: his beautiful face, his throat, stomach, buttocks, his 
dangling testicles, which seemed as large as a bull's. Sara arched up toward him, wanting 
to be as close as she possibly could, wanting every inch, yes, wanting everything of him 
that there was. Even his real name, which he wouldn't tell her. 

"We've earned this weekend," Sam said. "It's also necessary, Sara. Rest and relaxation 
are a real part of war, an important part. 

Jack and Jill is going to get progressively harder from here on. 

Everything escalates now." 

Sara couldn't help smiling as she stared up at Sam's face. God she loved being with him. 
Under him, over him, sideways, upside down. She loved his touch -- sometimes strong, 
sometimes so surprisingly gentle. She loved, yes, every inch of him. 

She'd never felt like this before, never thought that she would. 

She would have bet anything against its happening. In a way, she had bet everything, 
hadn't she? For the cause, but also for Sam, for this. 

Sam was such a closet romantic, too. It was so unexpected from The Soldier, from any 
man she had known before. The suite at the Four Seasons was his idea, just because she 
had mentioned -- mentioned it once -- that it was her favorite hotel in Washington. 

"Say," she said to him now, whispering during their lovemaking, "do you want to know 
my favorite hotel in the whole wide world?" 


He got the joke -- he got all of her humor and twisted ironies. 

His large blue eyes sparkled. He grinned. He had brilliantly white teeth, and such a shy, 
disarming smile. She thought he was much better looking than Michael Robinson had 
been. Sam was a real-life action hero. The Soldier. In a real war for survival, the most 
important war of our times. They both believed that to be the truth. 

"Please, don't tell me the answer," he said with a laugh. "Don't you dare tell me your 
favorite hotel in the world. You know I'll have to take you there somehow if you do. 
Don't tell me, Sara!" 

"The Cipriani in Venice," Sara blurted out, laughing. 

She had never actually been there, but she'd read so much about it. She had read about 
everything, but experienced so little until recently Sara the hopeless bookworm, Sara the 
bibliophile, Sara the cipher. Well, no more. Now she lived as almost no one had before. 
Sara the gimp lives! 

"Okay, then. When this is all over -- and this will end -- we'll go to Venice, for a holiday 
I promise you. The Cipriani it is." 

"And Sunday brunch at the Danieli," she whispered against his cheek. "Promise?" 

"Of course. Where else but the Danieli for brunch? That's a given. As soon as this is 
finished." 

"It's going to get worse, isn't it?" she said, hugging his powerful body a little tighter. 

"Yes, I'm afraid so. But not tonight Jilly. Not tonight, my love. 

So let's not ruin this by thinking too much about tomorrow. Don't make a wonderful 
weekend into a bad Monday" 

Sam was right, of course. He was a wise man, too. He started to move again on top of 
her. He flowed like a fast river current over the top of her. He was such a generous and 
beautiful lover; he was both teacher and student; he knew how to gve and take in bed. 
Most important, Sam knew how to bring her out of herself. 

God, she had needed that -- forever, it seemed. To get outside of herself. Not to be the 
gimp anymore. Not ever again. She promised herself that. 

Sara pursed her lips tightly. In pleasure? In pain? She wasn't even sure anymore. She 
shut her eyes, then quickly opened them. 

She wanted to look. 


He held himself over her, as if he were pausing during a push-up. "So you've never been 
to the Cipriani, Monkey Face?" he asked. His cheeks weren't even flushed. He 
effortlessly held himself over her. His body was so beautiful, strong and agile, rock-
solid. Sara was in good shape also, but Sam was superb. 

He called her "Monkey Face," from Hitchcock's Suspicion. It wasn't really such a great 
movie, but it had hit the spot for them, hit their spot. Ever since they'd seen it, she'd been 
the Joan Fontaine character, Lena. He was Johnny, who had been played by Cary Grant. 
Johnny had called Lena "Monkey Face." 

At the end of the film, Lena and Johnny had driven off into a sunset on the Riviera, 
presumably to live happily ever after. The Hitchcock movie was an elegant, witty, 
mysterious game, just as this was. 

Their game. The most exquisite game two people had ever played together. 

Will we drive off into the sunset after all this? Sara Rosen wondered. Oh, I think not. I 
don't suppose that we will. What will happen to us, then? Oh, what will happen to us? 
What will become of Jack and Jill? 

"I've only been to the Cipriani in my dreams," she confessed to Sam. "Only in dreams. 
But, yes, I've been there many, many times." 

"Is this all a dream, Monkey Face?" Sam asked. His look was serious for a moment. She 
couldn't help thinking how precious every moment like this was, and how fleeting. She 
had secretly yearned for this all of her life, for one truly romantic experience. 

"I think it's a dream, yes. It's like a dream anyway Please don't wake me, though, Sam." 

"It's not a dream," Sam whispered. "I love you. You are the most lovable woman I've 
ever met. You are, Sara. You're like staying at the Cipriani every day for me. Please 
believe that, Monkey Face. 

Believe in us. I do." 

He clasped Sara from behind and pulled her closer. She savored the sweetness of his 
breath, the smell of his cologne, the smell of him. 

He began to move inside her and she felt herself melting into a liquid force. She did love 
him -- she did, she did, she did. Her hands ran all over him, touching, possessing. There 
had never been anything like this before in her life, nothing even close. 

She slithered up and down on his long, powerful pole, his strength, his exquisite 
malehess. Sara couldn't stop herself now, and she didn't want to. She was choking with 
her own passion. 


She heard her voice crying out and almost didn't recognize herself. She was joined with 
him in a simple rhythm that got faster and faster as the two of them came closer to being 
one --Jack and Jill, Jack and Jill, Jack and Jill, Jack and Jill! 

THEIR FAIRY TALE ended with a quiet, almost disheartening thud, and Sara felt herself 
crashing back to earth, tumbling, being rushed along in a powerful tide. Monday 
morning meant a return to the dreary work world again, to real life. 

Sara Rosen had held "normal," boring jobs around Washington for fourteen years, ever 
since she'd graduated from Hollins College in Virginia. She had a day job now. A 
perfect job for their purposes. The dreariest and weariest of jobs. 

That morning, she rose early to get ready. She and Sam had separated on Sunday night at 
the Four Seasons. She missed him, missed his humor, missed his touch, missed 
everything about him. Every inch. 

She had gotten lost in that thought. Inches. Millimeters. The essence of Sam. His 
tremendous inner strength. She glanced at the luminescent face of the clock on her bed 
stand. She groaned out loud. Quarter to five. Dammit, she was already late. 

Her bathroom had a yoga corner with a custom-made leather mat. No time for that, 
though her body and mind ached for the discipline and the release. 

She took a quick shower and washed her hair with Salon Selectives shampoo. She put on 
a navy Brooks Brothers suit, low pumps, a leather-strapped Raymond Weil watch. She 
needed to look sharp, look alert, look freshly scrubbed this morning. 

Somehow, she always came out like that anyway. Sara the freshly starched. 

She hurried outside, where a grimy yellow cab was already waiting at the curb, wagging 
a tail of smoke. The wind whooped and howled up and down K Street. 

At five-twenty, the yellow cab pulled up in front of her workplace. The Liberty Cab 
driver smiled and said, "A famous address, my lady. 50, are you somebody famous?" 

She paid the driver and collected change from a five-dollar bill. 

"Actually, I might be someday," she said. "You never know." 

"Yeah, maybe I'm somebody, too," the driver said with a crooked smile. "You never 
know." 

Sara Rosen climbed out of the cab and felt the early December wind in her face. The 
pristine building before her looked strangely beautiful and imposing in the early-morning 
light. It appeared to be shining, actually, glowing from the inside out. 


She showed her ID card, and security let her pass inside. 

She and the guard even shared a quick laugh about her being a workaholic. And why 
not? Sara Rosen had worked inside the White House for nine years. 

PART 3 

THE PHOTOJOURNALIST 

THE PHOTOJOURNALIST was the last piece in the complex puzzle. He was the final 
player. He was working in San Francisco on December 8. Actually, the photojournalist 
was playing the game in San Francisco. Or rather, he was playing around the outer edges 
of the game. 

Kevin Hawkins sat in a scooped-out, gray plastic chair at Gate 31. He contentedly played 
chess with himself on a PowerBook. He was winning; he was losing. He enjoyed it 
either way Hawkins loved games, loved chess, and he was close to being one of the better 
players in the world. It had been that way ever since he'd been a bright, lonely, 
underachieving boy in Hudson, New York. At quarter to eleven he got up from his seat 
to go play another kind of game. This was his favorite game in the world. 

He was in San Francisco to kill someone. 

As he walked through the busy airport, Kevin Hawkins snapped off photograph after 
photograph -- all in his mind. 

The prizewinning photojournalist was outfitted in his usual studied-casual manner: tight 
black cord jeans with a black T-shirt, tribal bracelets from several trips to Zambia, a 
diamond stud earring. A Lcica camera was looped around his neck on a leather strap 
decorated with engravings. 

The photojournalist slipped into a crowded bathroom in Corridor C. He observed a 
ragged line of men slouched at the urinals. 

They are like pigs at a through, he thought. Like water buffalo, or oxen, taught to stand 
on their hind legs. 

His eye composed the shot and snapped it off. A beauty of order and sly wit. The Boys 
at the Bowl. 

The urinal scene reminded him of a clever pickpocket he had once seen operate in 
Bangkok. The thief, a keen student of human nature, would snatch wallets while gents 
were in midstream at a urinal and were reluctant, or unable, to go after him. 


The photojournalist couldn't forget the comical image whenever he entered an airport 
men's room. He rarely forgot any image, actually. His mind was a well-run archive, a 
rival to Kodak's vast storehouses of pictures in Rochester. 

He peered at his own image, a rather haggard and pasty-white face, in one of the cloudy 
bathroom mirrors. Unimpressive in every way, he couldn't help but think. His eyes were 
war-weary, an almost washed-out blue. Gazing at his eyes depressed him -- so much so 
that he sighed involuntarily. 

He saw no other mind pictures to take in the mirror. Never, ever, a picture of himself. 

He started to cough and couldn't stop. He finally brought up a thick packet of despicable, 
yellowish paste. His inner core, he thought. His animus was slowly leaking out. 

Kevin Hawkins was only forty-three, but he felt like a hundred. 

He had lived too hard, especially the last fourteen years. His life and times had been so 
very intense, often flamboyant and occasionally absurd. He had been burned, he often 
imagined, from every conceivable angle. He had played the game of life and death too 
hard, too well, too often. 

He started to cough again and popped a Halls into his mouth. 

Kevin Hawkins checked the time on his Seiko Kinetic wristwatch. 

He quickly finger-combed his lank, grayish blond hair and then left the public bathroom. 

He merged smoothly with the thick corridor traffic rolling past on the killing floor. It 
was almost time, and he was feeling a nice out-of-body buzz. He hummed an old, 
absolutely ridiculous song called "Rock the Casbah." He was pulling a dark Delsey 
suitcase hinged on one of those cheap roller contraptions that were so popular. The 
"walking" suitcase made him look like a tourist, like a nobody of the first order. 

The red-on-black digital clock over the airport passageway read 11:40. A Northwest 
Airlines jet from Tokyo had landed just a few minutes earlier. It had come into Gate 41, 
right on schedule. 

Somepeople just know how to fly. Wasn't that Northwest's tag line? 

The gods were smiling down on him; Kevin Hawkins felt a grim, humorless smile of his 
own. The gods loved the game, too. 

Life and death. It was their game, actually. 


He heard the first strains of a noisy commotion coming from the connecting Corridor B. 
The photojournalist kept walking ahead, until he was past the point where the two wide 
corridors connected. 

That was when he saw the phalanx of bodyguards and wellwishers He saw no other mind 
pictures to take in the mirror. Never, ever, a picture of himself. 

He started to cough and couldn't stop. He finally brought up a thick packet of despicable, 
yellowish paste. His inner core, he thought. His animus was slowly leaking out. 

Kevin Hawkins was only forty-three, but he felt like a hundred. 

He had lived too hard, especially the last fourteen years. His life and times had been so 
very intense, often flamboyant and occasionally absurd. He had been burned, he often 
imagined, from every conceivable angle. He had played the game of life and death too 
hard, too well, too often. 

He started to cough again and popped a Halls into his mouth.

The photojournalist kept walking ahead, until he was past the point where the two wide 
corridors connected. 

That was when he saw the phalanx of bodyguards and wellwishers. 


He clicked off a shot in his mind. He got a peek at Mr. Tanaka of the Nipray 


Corporation. He clicked another shot. 
His adrenaline was flowing like lava from Kilauea in Hawaii, where he'd once shot for 
Newsweek. Adrenaline. Nothing like it. 


He was addicted to the stuff. 
Any second now. 
Any second. 
Any nanosecond -- which, he knew, is to a second as a second is to about thirty years. 
There was no X-marks-the-spot on the terminal floor, but Kevin Hawkins knew this was 


the place. He had it all visualized, every critical angle was vivid as hell in his mind's eye. 
All the intersect points were clear to him. 
Any second. Life and death. 
There might as well have been a big black X painted on the airport floor. 
Kevin Hawkins felt like a god. 
Here we go. Cameras loaded and at the ready. Lock and load! 


Someone going to die here. 
WHEN THE SEMIOFFICIAL ENTOURAGE was approximately twelve feet from the 
busy corridor-crossing, a small bomb detonated. 


The explosion sent a cloud of gray-black smoke into Corridor A. Screams pierced the air 


like whining sirens. 
The bomb had been inside a dark blue suitcase left next to the news and magazine kiosk. 
Kevin Hawkins had placed the innocent-looking suitcase directly in front of a sign that 
advised travelers to WATCH YOUR LUGGAGE AT ALL TIMES. 


The deafening, booming noise and sudden chaos startled the bodyguards surrounding Mr. 
Tanaka. It made them erratic, and therefore predictable. Security teams, even the best of 
them, could be fooled if you forced them to improvise. Travelers and airport personnel 
were screaming, seeking cover where there was none to be had. Men, women, and 
children pressed themselves to the floor, faces hard against cold marble. 

People haven't seen real panic until they've witnessed it in a large airport, where everyone 
is already close to the edge of primal fears. 


Two of the bodyguards covered the corporate chairman, doing a half-way-decent job, 
Hawkins saw. 

He clicked another mind photo. Stored it in his photo file for future reference. 

This was good stuff, valuable as hell. How an excellent security team reacted under 
stress during an actual attack. 

Then the efficient, if uninspired, bodyguards began to hurriedly move their "protected 
person" out of danger, out of harm's way. They obviously couldn't go forward into the 
smoky, bombed-out corridor. The security team chose to go back- their only choice, the 
one Kevin Hawkins knew they would make under duress. 

They pulled along Mr. Tanaka as if he were a large, ungainly puppet or doll, which he 
pretty much was. They almost physically carried the important businessman, holding 
him under his arms so that both his feet left the floor at times. 

Mind photo of that: expensive black tasseled loafers skipping across the marble floor. 

The trained bodyguards had one goal: get the "protected person" out of there. The 
photojournalist let them proceed about thirty feet before he pushed the detonator in the 
shoulder bag housing his camera gear. It was that easy The best plans were one-button 
simple. Like a camera. Like a camera suitable for a child. 

A second suitcase he had left alongside the corridor near the men's room exploded with 
double the thunder and lightning of the first, causing more than twice the damage. It was 
as if an invisible missile had been guided directly into the center of the airport. 

The destruction was instantaneous, and it was brutal. Bodies, and even body parts, flew 
in every imaginable direction. Tanaka didn't survive. Neither did any of the four diligent 
and highly underpaid bodyguards. 

The photojournalist was tightly wedged in amidst the rushing wall of men and women 
trying to escape toward the airport exits. 

His was just another terrified face in the stormy human sea. 

And, yes, he could look very terrified. He knew more than any of them what fear looked 
like. He had photographed uncontrolled fear on so many faces. He often saw those 
awful looks of terror, those silent screams, in his dreams. 

He held back a tight, grim smile as he turned onto Corridor D and headed toward his own 
plane. He was going to Washington, D.C., that evening and hoped the delays caused by 
the murder wouldn't be massively long. 


The risk had been a necessary one, actually. This had been a rehearsal, the last rehearsal. 

Now, on to far more important things. The photojournalist had a very big job in D.C. 
The code name was easy enough for him to remember. 

Jack and Jill. 

"THE EIGHTEEN-ACRE ESTATE around the White House includes many diversions: a 
private movie theater, gym, wine cellar, tennis courts, bowling lanes, rooftop greenhouse, 
and a golf range on the South Lawn. The house and property are currently assessed at 
three hundred forty million by the District of Columbia." I could almost do the spiel 
myself. 

I showed my temporary pass, then carefully drove down into the parking garage under 
the White House. On the way in I had noticed some renovation to the main building and 
also extensive groundwork, but overall the White House looked just fine to me. 

My head was not so fine. It was uneasy Filled with chaotic thoughts. I had slept only a 
couple of hours the night before, and that was becoming a pattern. The morning's 
Washington Post and New York Times lay folded on the car seat beside me. 

The Post headline asked Who's NEXT FOR JACK AND JILL? It seemed like a question 
directed right at me. who's NEXT? 

I thought about a possible attempt on the life of President Thomas Byrnes, as I walked 
from the small parking garage to the elevator. A lot of people were extremely high on the 
President and his programs. Americans had clamored for change for a long time, and 
President Byrnes was delivering it in large doses. Of course, what most people want 
"change" to mean is more money in their pockets, instantly, without any sacrifice on their 
part. 

So who might be angry and crazed enough at the President to want him murdered? I 
knew that was why I was at the White House. I was here to conduct a homicide 
investigation. In the White House. A search for a couple of killers who could be 
planning to murder the President. 

I met Don Hamerman in the West Wing Entrance Hall. He was still acting extremely 
high strung and anxious, but that seemed to be his persona. It also fit the times. The chief 
of staff and I talked for a few minutes in the hallway He went out of his way to tell me 
that I had been handpicked for the investigation because of my expertise with high-
profile killers, especially psychopaths. 

He seemed to know an awful lot about me. As he talked, I imagined that he'd probably 
gotten the coveted brownnoser award in his senior year at Yale or Harvard, where he had 
also learned to talk with a whiny, upper-class drawl. 


I had absolutely no idea what to expect that morning. 

Hamerman said he was going to line up some "interviews" for me. I sensed some of his 
frustration in trying to organize an investigation like this inside the White House. A 
murder investigation. 

He left me alone inside the Map Room on the ground floor. 

I paced around the famous room, absently checking out the' elaborately carved 
Chippendale furniture, an oil portrait of Ben Franklin, a landscape painting titled Tending 
Cows and Sheep. I already had a busy day ahead. I had appointments set up at the city 
morgue and with Benjamin Levitsky, the number two at the FBI's intelligence unit. 

I continued to be frustrated about the Truth School child murders. 

For the moment, that was Sampson's concern. Sampson's and our part-time posse of 
detectives'. But I couldn't keep it off my mind. 

Suddenly, someone entered the Map Room along with the national security advisor. I 
was taken by surprise. I was blown away, actually. No words could possibly describe 
the feeling. 

Don Hamerman stiffly announced, "President Byrnes will see you now." 

"GOOD MORNING. Is it Doctor or Detective Cross?" President Thomas Byrnes asked 
me. 

I had a sneaking suspicion that Dr. Cross would serve me much better at the White 
House. Like Dr. Bunche, Dr. Kissinger, or even Doc Savage. "I guess that I prefer 
Alex," I said to him. 

The President's face lit up in a broad smile, and it was the same charismatic one I had 
seen many times on television and on the front pages of newspapers. 

"And I prefer Tom," the President said. He extended his hand and the two of us shook 
off our surnames. His grip was firm and steady. He held eye contact with me for several 
seconds. 

The President of the United States managed to sound both cordial and appropriately 
serious at the same time. He was about six feet tall, and he was trim and fit at fifty. His 
hair was light brown, trimmed with silver-gray He looked a little like a fighter pilot. His 
eyes were very sensitive and warm. He was already known as our most personable 
president in many years, and also our most dynamic. 

I had read and heard a lot about the man I was meeting for the first time. He had been the 
successful and much-admired head of the Ford Motor Company in Detroit before he 


decided to go for an even higher executive office. He had run for the presidency as an 
Independent, and true to the polls of the past few years, the people had voted for fresh, 
independent thinking -- or maybe they were just voting against the Republican and 
Democratic Parties, as some pundits believed. So far, he had shown himself to be a 
contemporary thinker, but a bit contrarian, a genuine maverick in high office. As an 
independent mover and shaker, the President had made few friends in Washington, but 
lots of enemies. 

"The director of the FBI highly recommended you," he said. 

"I think Stephen Bowen's a pretty good man. What do you think? 

Any opinion of him?" 

"I agree with you. The Bureau has changed a lot in the past couple of years under 
Bowen. We work well with them now. That didn't used to be the case." 

The President nodded. "Is this a real threat, Alex, or are we just taking wise 
precautions?" he asked me. It was a tough, blunt question. I also thought it was the right 
question to ask. 

"I think the concern of the Secret Service is definitely a wise precaution," I said. "The 
coincidence of the names Jack and Jill being the same as your code names with the Secret 
Service, that's very disturbing. So is the killers' pattern of going after famous people here 
in Washington." 

"I guess I fit that damn description. Sad but true," President Byrnes said and frowned. I 
had read that he was an intensely private man and down-to-earth as well. He seemed that 
way to me. Midwestern in the best sense. I guess what surprised me the most was the 
warmth that came from the man. 

"As you have admitted yourself, you're 'shaking up the toy box." You've already 
disturbed a lot of people." 

"Stay tuned, there are a lot more major disturbances to come. 

This government badly needs to be reengineered. It was designed for life in the eighteen 
hundreds. Alex, I'm going to cooperate in any way I can with the police investigation. I 
don't want anyone else to be hurt, let alone die. I've certainly thought about it, but I'm not 
ready to die yet. I think Sally and I are decent people. I hope you'll feel that way the 
more you're around us. We're far from perfect, but we are decent. We're trying to do the 
right thing." 

I was already feeling that way about the President. He had quickly struck a good chord 
with me. At the same time, I wondered how much of what he'd said I could believe. He 
was, after all, a politician. The best in the land. 


"Every year, several people try to break into the White House, Alex. One man succeeded 
by tagging onto the end of the marine marching band. Quite a few have tried to ram the 
front gates with cars. In ninety-four, Frank Eugene Corder flew a single-engine Cessna 
in here." 

"But so far, nothing like this," I said. 

The President asked the real question on his mind. "What's your bottom line on Jack and 
Jill?" 

"No bottom line yet. Maybe a morning line," I told him. 

"I disagree with the FBI. I don't see them as pattern killers. 

They're highly organized, but the pattern seems artificial to me. 

I'll bet they're both attractive, white, with well above normal IQ. They have to be 
articulate and persuasive to get into the places that they did. They want to accomplish 
something even more spectacular. What they've done so far is only groundwork. 

They enjoy the power of manipulating both us and the media. 

That's what I have so far. It's what I'm prepared to talk about, anyway." 

The President nodded solemnly. "I have a good feeling about you, Alex," he said. "I'm 
glad we met for a couple of minutes here. I was told that you have two children," he said. 
He reached into his jacket and handed me a presidential tie clasp and a pin especially 
designed for kids. "Keepsakes are important, I think. 

You see, I believe in tradition as well as in change." 

President Byrnes shook my hand again, looked me directly in the eye for a moment, and 
then left the room. 

I understood that I had just been welcomed to the team, and the sole purpose of the team 
was to protect the President's life. I found that I was powerfully motivated to do just that. 
I looked down at the tie clasp and pin for Damon and Jannie and was strangely moved. 

"SO DID YOU get to meet the royal couple yet?" Nana Mama asked when I entered her 
kitchen about four that afternoon. 

She was making something in a big gray stewpot that smelled like the proverbial 
ambrosia. It was white bean soup, one of my favorites. Rosie the cat was prowling 
around on the counters, purring contentedly Rosie in the kitchen. 


At the same time Nana cooked at the counter, she was doing the crossword puzzle in the 
Washington Post. A book of her word jumbles was also out in view. So was No Stone 
Unturned -- The Life and Times of Maggie Kuhn. Complicated woman, my grandmother. 

"Did I meet who?" I pretended not to understand her crystal-. 

clear and very pointed question to me. I was playing the game that the two of us have 
had going for many years, and probably will until death do us part somehow, sometime, 
someway. 

"Meet whom, Dr. Cross. The President and Mrs. President, of course. The well-to-do 
white folks who live in the White House, looking down on the rest of us. Tom and Sally 
up in Camelot for the nineties." 

I smiled at her usual high-spirited and occasionally bittersweet banter. I looked in the 
fridgc. "I didn't come home for the third and fourth degree, you know. I'm going to 
make a sandwich from this brisket. It looks moist and tender. Or are looks deceiving?" 

"Of course they are, but this brisket is moist and you could cut it with a soup spoon. 
Seems as if they work very short hours over at the White House, considering all that they 
have to do. 

Somehow, I suspected as much. But I could never prove it until now. So who did you 
meet?" 

I couldn't resist. I had been going to tell her this much anyway. 

"I met and talked with the President this morning." 

"You met Tom?" 

Nana pretended to take a punch in the manner of the heavyweight boxer George 
Foreman. She did a stumbling stutter-step back from the counter. She even cracked a 
tiny smile. "Well, tell me all about Tom, for heaven's sake. And Sally. Does Sally wear 
a black pillbox hat inside the White House in the daytime?" 

"I think that was Jacqueline Kennedy. Actually, I liked President Byrnes," I said as I 
commenced making a thick brisket sandwich on fresh rye with bib lettuce, tomatoes, and 
a dab of mayonnaise, lots of pepper, a whisk of salt. 

"You would. You like everybody unless they kill somebody," Nana said as she began to 
slice up some more tomatoes. "Now that you've met Mr. President, you can get back on 
the Sojourner Truth School case. That's very important to the people in this house. The 
Gray House. No black people care very much about the President and his problems 
anymore. Nor should they." 


"Is that a fact, Mrs. Farrakhan?" I said as I bit into my sandwich. 

Delicious, as promised. Cut it with a soup spoon, melts in the mouth. 

"Should be a fact, if it isn't. It's close to a fact, anyway. I'll admit that it's a sad state of 
affairs, but it's the sad state we all live in. Don't you agree? You must." 

"You ever hear of mellowing with age?" I asked her. "Your brisket is terrific, by the 
way." 

"You ever hear of getting better, not getting older? You ever hear of taking care of one's 
own kind? You ever hear about teeny-tiny, darling black children being murdered in our 
neighborhood, Alex, and nobody doing enough to make it stop? Of course the brisket is 
excellent. You see, I am getting better." 

I reached into my trouser pocket and took out the clasp and pin that the President had 
given me. "The President knew I had two children. He gave me these keepsakes for 
them." I handed them over to Nana. She took them, and for once in her life, she was 
speechless. 

"Tell them that these are from Tom and that he's a fine man trying to do the right thing." 

I finished half of my overstuffed sandwich and took the remaining half With me out of 
the kitchen. If you can't stand the heat and all that. "Thanks for the delicious sandwich, 
and the advice. In that order." 

"Where are you going now?" Nana called after me. She was winding up again. "We 
were talking about an important matter. 

Genocide against black people right here in Washington, our nation's capital. They don't 
care what happens in these neighborhoods, Alex. They is them, and them is white, and 
you're collaborating with the enemy." 

"Actually, I'm going out to put in a few hours on the Truth School murder case," I called 
back as I continued toward the front door, and blessed escape from the tirade. I couldn't 
see Nana Mama anymore, but I could hear her voice trailing behind me like a banshee 
cry, or maybe the caw of a field crow. 

"Alex has finally found his senses!" she exclaimed in a loud, shrill voice. "There's hope 
after all. There's hope. Oh, thank you, Black Lord in Heaven." 

The old goat can still get my goat, and I love her for it. I just don't want to listen to her 
annoying rap sometimes. 


I beeped the car horn of my old Porsche on the way out of the driveway. It's our signal 
that everything is all right between us. From inside the house, I heard Nana call out: 
"Beep back at you!" 

I WAS BACK on the mean streets of inner Washington, the underside of the capital. I 
was a homicide detective again. I loved it with a strange passion, but there were times 
when I hated it with all my heart. 

We were doing all that could humanly be done on both cases. 

I had set up surveillance on the Truth School during the day and also had day and night 
surveillance on Shanelie Green's gravesite. 

Often psycho killers showed up at victims' graves. They were ghouls, after all. 

The circus was definitely in town. 

Two of them. 

Two completely different kinds of murder pattern. I had never seen anything like it, 
nothing even close to this chaos. 

I didn't need Nana Mama to remind me that I wanted to be out on the street right now. 
As she had said, Someone is killing our children. 

I was certain that the unspeakable monster was going to kill again. In contrast to Jack 
and Jill, there was rage and passion in his work. There was a raw, scary craziness, the 
kind I could almost taste. The killer's probable amateur status wasn't reassuring, either. 

Think like the killer. Walk in the killer's shoes, I reminded myself. 

laborating with the enemy."

Think like the killer. Walk in the killer's shoes, I reminded myself. 

That's how it all starts, but it's a lot tougher than it sounds. I was gathering as much 
information and data as I possibly could. 

I spent part of the afternoon ambushing several of the local hangarounds who might have 
picked up something on the murders: convivial street people, swooning pipeheads, young 
runners for the rock and weed dealers, a few low-level rollers themselves, store owners, 
snitches, Muslims selling newspapers. 

I gave some of them a tough time, but nobody had anything useful for me. 

I kept at The Job anyway. That's the way it goes most days. You just keep at it, keep 
your head down and screwed on straight. 


About quarter past five, I found myself talking to a seventeen-year-old homeless youth I 
knew from working the soup kitchen at St. Anthony's. His name was Loy McCoy, and he 
was a low-level crack runner now. He had helped me once or twice in the past. 

Loy had stopped coming by for free food once he had started moving nickel and dime 
bags of crack and speed around the neighborhood. It's hard to blame kids like Loy, as 
much as I would like to some days. Their lives are unbelievably brutal and hopeless. 

Then one day someone comes along and offers them fifteen or twenty bucks an hour to 
do what's going to happen anyway The more powerful emotional hook is that their dope 
bosses believe in them, and in many cases nobody has believed in any of these lost kids 
before. 

I called Loy over, away from the posse of fools he was hanging with on L Street. They 
all wore black, machine-knit wool caps pulled low over their eyes and ears. Gold 
toothcaps, hoop earrings, baggy trousers, the works. His gang was talking about the 
movie based on the old Flintstones cartoon, or maybe about the actual cartoons. Yabba 
dabbas was one of the catchphrases used to describe police patrolmen and detectives in 
the 'hood. Here comes the yabba dabba. Or, he's a yabba dabba doo motherfucker. I had 
recently read a sad statistic that seventy percent of Americans got nearly one hundred 
percent of their information from television and the movies. 

Loy smirked as he slow-shuffled up to me at the street corner. 

He was maybe six one, but about only a hundred and forty pounds. He had on baggy, 
layered winter clothes, artfully torn, and he was "grittin" me today, trying to stare me 
down, put me down. 

"Yo, you say c'mon over, I got to come?" Loy asked in a defiant tone that I found both 
irritating and monumentally sad. 

"Whyzat? I pay my taxes," he rapped on. "I aren't holdin'. Ain't none of us holdin'." 

"None of your bullshit attitude works on me," I told him. 

"You better lose it right now." I knew that his mother was a heroin addict and that he had 
three little sisters. All of them lived at the Greater Southeast Community Hospital 
shelter, which was like having the tunnels under Union Station as your home address. 

"Say your business, an' I get back to my business," Loy said, remaining defiant. "My 
time's money, unnerstand? Axt me what you got to axt." 

"Just one question for you, Loy. Then you can go back to your big money business 
dealings." 


He kept "grittin" me, which can get you shot in this neighborhood. "Why I have to 
answer any questions? What's in it for me? What you have to deal?" 

I finally smiled at Loy and he cracked a half-smile himself, showing off his shiny gold 
caps. "You give me something, maybe I'll remember. Then maybe I'll owe you one 
sometime," I said. 

"Yo," he came right back at me. "Wanna know a big fat secret, Detective? I don't need 
your markers. And I don't much care about these murdered kids' homo-cides you lookin' 
into." He shrugged as if it were no big deal on the street. I already knew that. 

I waited for him to finish his little speech, and also to process my offer. The sad thing 
was that he was bright. Crazy smart. That was why the crack boss had hired him. Loy 
was smart enough, and he probably even had a decent work ethic. 

"I can't talk to you! Don't have to, neither!" he finally did a little exasperated spin and 
threw up both his skinny arms. "You think I owe you 'cause once upon a time you fed us 
Manhandler soup-slop at the po'boy kitchen? Think I owe you? I don't owe you shit!" 

Loy started to strut away. Then he looked back at me, as if he had just one more 
irritating wisecrack to hurl my way. His dark eyes narrowed, caught mine, and held on 
for a second. Contact. 

Liftoff. 

"Somebody saw an old man where that little girl got kilt," Loy blurted out. It'was the 
biggest news we had so far on the Truth School case. It was the only news, and it was 
what I had been looking for all these days working the street. 

He had no idea how fast I was, or how strong. I reached out and pulled him close to me. 
I pulled Loy McCoy very close. So close I could smell the sweet peppermint on his 
breath, the scent of pomade in his hair, the mustiness of his badly wrinkled winter 
clothes. 

I held him to my chest as if he were a son of mine, a prodigal son, a young fool who 
needed to understand that I wasn't going to allow him to be this way with me. I held him 
real tight and I wanted to save him somehow. I wanted to save all of them, but I couldn't, 
and it was one of the big hurts and frustrations of my life. 

"I'm not fooling around here, now. Who told you that, Loy? 

You talk to me. Don't fuck with me on this. Talk to me, and talk to me now." 

His face was inches from mine. My mouth was almost pressed against his cheek. All of 
his street swagger and the attitude had disappeared. I didn't like being a tough guy with 
him, but this was important as hell. 


My hands are large and scarred, like a boxer's, and I let him see them. "I'm waiting for an 

answer," I whispered. "I will take you in. I will ruin your day and night." 
"Don't know who," he said between wheezing breaths. "Some people in the shelter be 
sayin' it. I just heard it, you know. 

Old homeless dude. Somebody saw'm hangin' in Garfield. White dude in the park." 

"A white man? On the southeast side of the park? You sure about that?" 

"That's right. What I said. What I heard. Now, let me go. 

C'mon, man, let go!" 

I let him pull away from me, walk away a few steps. 

Loy regained his composure and cool as soon as he realized that I wasn't going to hurt 


him,. or even take him in for questioning. 
"That's the story. You oweme," he said. "I'm gonna collect, too." 
I don't believe Loy saw the irony in what he was saying. 
"I owe you," I said. "Thanks, Loy." I hope you don't ever have to collect. 
He winked at me. "Be all you can be, all-riii!" he said and laughed and laughed as he 


walked back to the other crack runners. 
AN OLD HOMELESS MAN near the muzzler scene. In Garfield Park. That was 


something solid to work with, finally. I had paid some dues and gotten a return on 
investment. 
A white man. A white suspect. 
That was even more promising. There weren't too many white males hanging out in the 


Garfield Park area. That was for sure. 
I called Sampson and told him what I'd found out. He'd just come on duty for the night 


shift. I asked John how it was going on his end. He said that it wasn't going, but maybe 
now it would. 
He would let the others in our group know. 
At a little past five, I stopped by the Sojourner Truth School again. There were several 


forces strongly pulling me in the direction of the school. The new information about the 



homeles white man and the constant feeling that just maybe my nemesis Gary Soneji 
might be involved. That was part of it. Then there was Christine johnson. Mrs. Johnson. 

Once again, nobody was sitting at the desk in the outer office. 
The multiracial dolls on the desk looked abandoned. So did some "face doodles" and a 
couple of Goosebump books. The hea/ wooden door into the main office was shut tight. 


I couldn't hear anyone inside, but I knocked anyway I heard a drawer bang shut, then 


footsteps. The door opened. It wasn't locked. 
Christine Johnson had on a cashmere jacket and long wool skirt. Her hair was pulled 
back and tied with a yellow bow. 


She was wearing her glasses. Working barefoot. I thought of a line- from Dorothy 


Parker, I think- Men seldom make passes/At girls who wear glasses. 
Seeing her lifted my spirits, brought me up immediately I didn't know exactly why, but it 
did. 


It occurred to me that she worked late at the school a lot. That was her business, but I 


wondered why she spent so much time here. 
"Yes, I'm working late again. You caught me in the act. Red-handed, guilty as charged. 
A friend of yours dropped by the school this morning," she said. "A detective John 
Sampson." 


"He's in charge of the case," I said. 


"He seems very dedicated and concerned. Surprising in a lot of ways. He's reading 
Camus," she said. 
I wondered how he had worked that into their conversation. 
Among other noble pursuits, Sampson is dedicated to meeting interesting and attractive 


women, like Christine Johnson. It wouldn't bother him that she was married, unless it 
bothered her. 

Sampson can be chivalrous to a fault, but only if it's appreciated. 
"Sampson reads a lot, always has since I've known him. My grandmother taught him in 
school, before I met him, actually He's the original Pagemaster." 


Christine Johnson smiled, showed me all those beautiful teeth of hers. "You're familiar 
with the movie Pagemaster? I guess you must see them all." 


"I do see them all. Anything the kids 'have to, have to see, Daddy!" We gave Pagemaster 
a six. But we're not as down on Master Macauley Culkin as some people seem to be." 

She continued to smile and seemed to be an extremely nice person. Smart enough to do 
many things- patient and concerned enough to do this difficult job in the city. I envied 
her students. 

I got right down to the business I had at the school. "The reason I stopped by is that 
there's a possible ID on the killer -- a start, anyway. I heard about it this afternoon, not 
too long ago." 

Christine Johnson listened closely to what I had to say. Her brow furrowed deeply Her 
brown eyes were intense. She was a good listener, which, if I remembered correctly, was 
unusual for a school principal. 

"An older man, a white man, was seen in the vicinity of where Shanelle Green was 
originally abducted in Garfield Park. He was described as a street person. Possibly a 
homeless man. Not very big, with a full white beard, wearing a brown or black poncho." 

"Should I tell that to the teachers? What about the children?" she asked as I finished the 
description. 

"I'd like to have someone stop by here tomorrow morning to talk to the teachers again," I 
said. "We don't know if this lead is anything, but it could be important. It's the best thing 
we have so far." 

"An ounce of prevention," she said, then smiled. Actually, she laughed at herself. 
"That's what is known, derogatively, as 'teacher talk." You can catch a dose of it if you 
hang around here too much. Too many clichs. You sometimes find yourself talking to 
other adults as if they were five or six years old. It drives my husband crazy." 

"Is your husband a teacher, too?" I asked. It just came out. Shit. 

She shook her head and seemed amused for some reason. 

"No, no. George is a lawyer. He'S a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, actually Fortunately, he's 
only trying to push the interests of energy businesses. Occidental Petroleum, Pepco 
Energy Company, the Edison Electric Institute. I can live with that." She laughed. 

"Well, most of the time I can." Her look was innocent, but not naive. Maybe just a little 
conspiratorial. 

"Well, I wanted to pass on the news about our suspect. Maybe we have a real suspect 
this time," I said. "I've got to run." 

"Don't," Christine Johnson said, and I stopped short, startled a little. 


Then she smiled that knowing smile of hers. Quietly dazzling and appealing as could be. 
"Absolutely no running in the halls," she winked at me. 
"Gotcha!" Cute. 
I laughed and was on my merry way, back to work after a brief moment of sweetness and 


light. I did like her quite a lot. Who wouldn't? Maybe we could be friends somehow, 
someway, but probably not. 

Nothing was coming out right; nothing was working very well. 
An old homeless white man was the best we could do. It wasn't bad police work, but it 
wasn't enough. Not even close. Two impossible cases. Jesus! 


I pulled my car way down the street and watched the Truth School for a couple of hours 
that night. My son's school. Maybe a homeless white man would come by -- but one 
didn't. 

I left the stakeout about half an hour after Christine Johnson left hers. 

"WHAT DO YOU THINK of our magic carpet ride so far? On a scale of one to eleven?" 
Jack asked Jill, Sam asked Sara. They were floating high over the Maryland countryside. 
"It's absolutely beautiful. It's as thrilling as can be. Unbelievable. 
The simple joy of flying like a bird." 
"Hard to imagine that this is work. But it is, Monkey Face. 
This could be important for us, for everything we're doing, for the game." 
"I know that, Sam. I'm paying attention." 
"I know you are. Always so diligent." 
The two of them were sitting close together inside the tiny cockpit of a Blanik L-23 


sailplane. They had flown the sailplane out of Frederick Municipal Airport in Maryland, 
about an hour from downtown Washington. It was the perfect treat for herl Sara couldn't 
help thinking. The perfect metaphor. The gimp was flying. Unbelievable. Her entire 
life was that way now. 

Down below, she could see Frederick, with its many examples of German Colonial 
architecture. She could actually make out several of the cutesy-pie shops on Antique 
Walk in town. The sky was filled with cumulus, like cotton balls moving lightly over a 


calm sea. Sara had told Sam that she'd gone up in a sail-plane once, and it was "just 
about the best thing I've ever done." 

He'd said, "We'll go tomorrow afternoon. I know just the place, Monkey Face. Perfect! 
I want to fly over Camp David, where the President goes to stay I want to look down on 
President Byrnes's retreat. I want to drop an imaginary bomb on his ass." 

Sam Harrison already knew a great deal about Camp David, but the view from the air 
could be useful anyhow. An attack on the presidential retreat was a very real possibility 
in the future -- especially if the Secret Service continued to keep President Byrnes tightly 
under wraps, as they had for the past few days. 

Everything about Jack and Jill was so much harder now, but he had expected that. It was 
why they had several plans, not just one. The President of the United States was going to 
die -- it was just a matter of when and where. The how had already been decided. Soon 
the when and where would be taken care of as well. 

"Isn't this risky, flying so close to Camp David?" Sara asked. 

He smiled at the question. He knew that she had been biting her tongue as they floated 
north from Frederick, inching closer and closer to the presidential outpost, closer and 
closer to danger, maybe even disaster. 

"So far, it's not too risky. Sailplanes and hot-air balloons do it all the time. Catch a 
distant peek at where the President stays. 

He's not here right now, so they're not as paranoid on the ground. 

We can't get too close, though. Ever since that plane landed at the White House, this 
airspace is protected with missiles. I doubt they'd shoot down a sailplane, but who 
knows?" 

They could see the buildings at Fort David below, just a little to the northeast in Catoctin 
Mountain Park. There were three Army Jeeps left in the open. No one seemed to be out 
on the well-wooded grounds today, though. Camp David itself looked rather odd: a 
strange cross between Army barracks and a rustic vacation place. Not too formidable. 
Nothing they couldn't work with, if need be, if the final plan demanded it. 

"Camp David. Named after Eisenhower's grandson,"Jack said. 

"Pretty good president, Ike. Generals usually are." 

Jack touched the holstered Beretta on his ankle. The gun was reassuring. But nothing 
was going to happen to the President right now, or to Jack and Jill. No, the game was 
about to go off in another direction. That was the beauty of it -- no one could predict 
where it would go. It was a game, designed as one, played as one. 


He felt Sara's hand lightly touch his cheek. "How much longer do we have?" she asked. 
He suspected that she didn't want the sailplane ride to end. 

"They'll never catch us," he said and smiled. 
"No, the ride, silly," she laughed and patted his arm. "How much longer do we have up 
here?" 


"You're not bored already? We're nowhere near the world's altitude record -- about forty-
nine thousand feet, if I recall. Need a hell of a wave lift for that." Suddenly, he seemed 
concerned that she might not be having a good time. That was just like Sam. 

"No, no," she laughed and put her arm around his neck. Sara held him tightly "I love it 
up here, love flying, love being with you. Thank you -- for everything." 
"You're welcome, Monkey Face," he whispered against her cheek. 
Two incredible killers. 
Jack and Jill. 


Flying over the President's famous retreat at Camp David. 
See you soon, Mr. President. There nothing you can do to stop this from happening. 
Nowhere you can hide from us. Trust us on that. 


Haven't we kept all of our promises so far? 
ON THE HOUR-LONG DRIVE back to Washington, Sam seemed distracted and distant. 


Sara cautiously watched him out of the corner of her eye. It was as if he were still up in 
the sail-plane. 
His brow was furrowed, his deep-blue eyes set on the road ahead. 
He could get like this sometimes; but then again, so could she. 
Sara the worrier. Sara the drudge. 
They both understood and mostly accepted the good and the bad points about each other. 


The game of Jack and Jill was getting much tougher now for both of them. Every move 
was chancy and fraught with danger. They could be caught before the mission was 
completed. The hunters were all over the place. 

One of the largest manhunts in history was under way. Not only in Washington, D.C., 
but everywhere around the world. 


"I was just thinking about the game and how it's going, an honest evaluation. I was 
considering- a game inside our game," Sam finally said. "Something more sophisticated. 
Completely unexpected by our trackers." 

Sara watched him detaching from his reverie, coming away from it, coming back to her. 

"Yes, I could see that you were somewhere other than here on the beltway with me and 
all of these commuters. That much was pretty obvious." 

Sam grinned. "Sorry. You probably smelled the wood burning, too." He was incredibly 
self-effacing -- something else she enjoyed about him. He didn't seem to realize that he 
was something special; or if he did, he kept it to himself. God, it was so easy when they 
were together, so hard when they were apart. 

Sara wondered how she had survived before she met Sam. The answer was, Basically, 
she hadn't. She had been alive, but she didn't have a life. Now, she did. 

"You're concerned about the progress of the game from here on, the exact sequence," she 
said. "It's furrowed your brow. Poor dear Sam. What's your idea?" 

He smiled and shook his head. He often told her how perceptive and intelligent she was. 
Not many men had ever said that to Sara Rosen -- practically none, in fact. Her 
intelligence scared most men. Even worse, she was verbal. So men usually needed to 
keep her down, to put her down constantly, to belittle anything she said that they we road 
ahead. 

He could get like this sometimes; but then again, so could she. 

Sara the worrier. Sara the drudge.

keep her down, to put her down constantly, to belittle anything she said that they weren't 
entirely one hundred percent comfortable with. 

Sam wasn't that way. He seemed to understand exactly what she needed. Is that part of 
the game, too? she wondered. Part of his game? 

"There's going to be tremendous heat from the police and FBI coming our way soon," he 
said, staring straight ahead at the gray ribbons of roadway. "What's gone before was 
nothing, Sara, absolutely nothing. The manhunt will increase exponentially from here on. 
They want to capture us badly. The FBI is assembling the best team possible, and make 
no mistake, it will be an impressive group. Sooner or later, they'll find something on us. 
It's inevitable that they will." 

Sara nodded in agreement. Still, he had frightened her. "I know that. i'm ready for it; at 
least, think I am. You have an idea how to deal with this blistering heat that's coming our 
way?" 

"Yes, I think I do. It's something I've been thinking about for a while, but I believe I've 
solved it. Let me try this one out on you. 

Tell me what you think." 

See? He did want her opinions. Always. He was so different from the others. 

He looked over at her, made eye contact. "It's so simple, really. 

We need perfect alibis. I have an idea how to accomplish that. It involves a slight 
change in our game plan, but I think it's worth it." 


She tried to keep the concern out of her voice. "What kind of change? You don't want to 
go after the target we already agreed on?" 

"I want to change the next target, yes, but I want to change something else as well. I 
want to get someone else to do the next kill. That way, we'll both have airtight alibis. I 
think it's a powerful twist. I think it could be the clincher for us. If anyone is onto either 
of us, this will throw them off completely." 

They were coming down Wisconsin Avenue and into Washington. The city looked like 
aJ. M. W. Turner painting, Sara decided. Hazy light, caught just right. "I like your 
thinking a lot. 

It's a good plan. Who would you get?" she asked. 

"I've already made a contact," Sam said. "I think I have the perfect person for this little 
twist. He thinks the way we do, believes in the cause. He happens to be right here in 
Washington." 

A SECRET SERVICE AGENT named James McLean, one of Jay Grayer's lieutenants, 
walked me around the White House. More than a million visitors come here every year, 
but this was the show none of them got. This was the real deal. 

Instead of the usual tour of Library, East, Blue, Green, and Red Rooms, I got to see the 
private family quarters on the second and third floors. I requested a viewing of the 
President's offices in the West Wing, as well as Vice President Mahoney's in the 
Executive Office Building. 

As the two of us wandered through the impressive Center Hall, with its bright yellow 
color scheme, I half expected either "Ruffles and Flourishes" or "Hail to the Chief" to 
suddenly ring out. 

Agent McLean was filling me in on details about security at the White House. The 
grounds were covered by audio and pressure sensors, electronic eyes, and infrared. A 
SWAT team was on the roof at all times now. Helicopters were less than two and a half 
minutes away. Somehow, I wasn't comforted by the tight security 

"What do you think of all this?" McLean asked as he led me into the Cabinet Room. It 
was dominated by serious-looking leather chairs, each bearing a brass plaque with the 
cabinet member's title. A very impressive place to visit. 

"What I'm thinking is that every person working here has to be checked out," I said. 

"They've all been checked, Alex." 

"I know that. They haven't been checked by me, though. 


We need to check them all over again. I'd like each of them run against an interest in 
poetry or literature, even college degrees in literature; any kind of filmmaking 
experience; painting, sculpting, any endeavor requiring creativity. I'd like to know what 
magazines they subscribe to. Also their charitable contributions." 

If McLean had an opinion on all that, he kept it to himself. 

"Anything else?" he asked. 

We were looking out over the Rose Garden. I could see office buildings off in the 
distance, so I assumed they could see us. I didn't like that too much. 

"Year, I'm afraid so," I went on. "While we're doing those background checks, we need 
to look at everyone in the crisis group. 

You can start with me." 

Agent James McLean stared at me for a long moment. 

"You're shitting me, aren't you?" he finally spoke his mind. 

I spoke my mind, too. "I shit you not. This is a murder investigation. This is how it's 
done." 

The dragonslayer had come to the White House. 

THE PHOTOJOURNALIST had chosen a conservative dark gray suit and a striped rep's 
tie for the sold-out performance of Miss Saigon at the Kennedy Center. 

He had cut his grayish blond hair short; the ponytail was long gone. He no longer wore a 
diamond stud earring. It was doubtful whether anyone he knew would have recognized 
him. Just as it should be, as it had to be from now until the end of the game. 

"Seems like old times," Kevin Hawkins sang softly as he crossed a parking lot facing 
USA Today headquarters across the river in Rosslyn. 

"Keep those big presses running," he muttered under his breath. "Might have something 
for you later. Might just have a big, late-breaking story tonight at the Kennedy Center. 
Quien sabe?" 

He was so glad to be back in Washington, where he'd lived at various times in the past. 
He was happy to be back in the game as well. The game of games, he couldn't help 
thinking, and believing it in his heart. Code name: Jack and Jill. Intrigue just didn't get 
any better than this. It couldn't. 


There were two essential parts to his psychological buildup as he approached the difficult 
evening ahead. The first part was to make himself as cautious, as suspicious, as paranoid, 
as he possibly could. The second part, equally important, was to pump himself up with a 
full megadose of confidence so that he would succeed. 

He could not fail. He would not fail, he told himself. His job was to murder someone -- 
often a well-known someone, sometimes in public view -- and not get caught. 

In public view. 

And not get caught. 

So far, he had never been caught in the act. 

He found it curious, though not particularly disturbing anymore, that he had little or no 
conscience, no guilt about the killings; and yet he could be perfectly normal in many 
other areas of his life. His sister, Eileen, for example, called him the "last believer" and 
the "last patriot." Her children thought he was the nicest, kindest Uncle Kevin 
imaginable. His parents back in Hudson adored him. He had plenty of nice, normal, 
close friends all around the globe. And yet here he was, ready for another cold-blooded 
kill. Looking forward to it, actually. Craving it. 

His adrenaline was pumping, but he felt less than nothing about the intended victim 
tonight. There were billions of people on the earth, far too many of them. What did one 
less human mean? Not a whole lot, any goddamn way you looked at it. If you took a 
logical view of the world. 

At the same time, he was extremely cautious as he entered the glittery Kennedy Center, 
with its gleaming crystal chandeliers and Matisse tapestries. He glanced up at the 
chandeliers in the Grand Foyer. With their hundreds of different prisms and lamps, they 
probably weighed a ton apiece. 

He was going to murder in public view, under the bright lights, under all these prisms and 
lamps. 

And not get caught! 

What an incredible magic trick. How good he was at this. 

His seat had been purchased for him, the theater ticket left in a locker at Union Station. 
The seat was in the back of the orchestra. 

It was almost underneath the "President's Box." Very nice. 

Just about perfect. He purposely arrived just as the houselights dimmed. 


He was actually surprised when the intermission came. So fast ! 

The time had really flown. The melodramatic stage play really moved along. 

He glanced at his wristwatch: 9:15. The intermission was right on schedule. The 
houselights came up and Hawkins idly observed that the crowd was highly enthused 
about the hit musical. 

This was good news for him: genuine excitement, ebullience, lots of noisy Small talk 
filling the air. He slowly rose from his cushy seat. Now for the night real drama, he was 
thinking. 

He entered the Grand Foyer with the huge chandeliers that resembled stalactites. The 
carpeting was a plush red sea beneath his feet. Up ahead was the proud bronze bust of 
John Kennedy. 

Very fitting and appropriate. 

Just so. Just right. 

Jack and Jill would be the biggest thing since Kennedy, and that was more than thirty 
years ago. He was happy to be a part of it. Thrilled, actually. He felt honored. 

For tonight performance, the part of Jack will be played by Kevin Hawkins. 

Watch closely now, theater fans. This act will be unforgettable. 

THE GRAND FOYER of the Kennedy Center was mobbed with uppity Washingtonian 
assholes. Theater people, Jesus. It was mostly an older crowd -- season subscribers. 
Tables were set up sellingjunky T-shirts and high-priced programs. A woman with a 
gaudy red umbrella was guiding a tour of high school kids through the intermission 
crowd. 

There was a very nasty and difficult trick to this killing, Kevin Hawkins knew. 

He had to get unbelievably close to the victim, physically close, before he actually 
committed the murder. 

That bothered him a lot, but there was no way around it. He had to get right on top of the 
target, and he could not fail at this part of the job. 

The photojournalist was thinking about it as he successfully blended into the noisily 
buzzing theater crowd. 

He eventually spotted Supreme Court Justice Thomas Henry, Franklin. Franklin was the 
youngest member of the current Court. He was an African-American. He looked 


haughty, which fitted his reputation around Washington. He was not a likable man. Not 
that it mattered. 

Snapshot Kevin Hawkins took a mind photo of Thomas Henry Franklin. 

On the justice's left arm was a twenty-three-year-old woman. 

Snapshot. Snapshot. 

Hawkins had done his homework on Charlotte Kinsey, too. He knew her name, of 
course. He knew that she was a second-year law student at Georgetown. He knew other 
dark secrets about Charlotte Kinsey and Justice Franklin as well. He had watched the 
two of them together in bed. 

He took another moment to observe Thomas Franklin and the college girl as they talked 
in the Grand Foyer. They were as animated and bubbly as any of the other couples there. 
Even more so. What great fun the theater could be! 

He took several more mind photos. He would never forget the image of the two of them 
talking together like that. 5napshot. And that. Snapshot. 

They laughed very naturally and spontaneously, and appeared to like each other's 
company Hawkins found himself frowning. 

He had two nieces in Silver Spring. The thought of the young law student with this 
middle-aged phony irked the hell out of him! 

The irony of his harsh judgment brought a sudden smile to his lips. The morality of a 
stone-cold killer -- how droll! How insane. 

How very cool. 

He watched the two of them move onto the large terrace off the lobby He followed 
several paces behind. The Potomac stretched out before them and was black as night. A 
dinner-cruise boat from Alexandria -- the Dandy -- was floating by The sheer curtains 
between the lobby and terrace flapped dramatically in the crisp river wind. Kevin 
Hawkins carefully moved toward the Supreme Court justice and his beautiful date. He 
took more mind photos of the two of them. 

He noted that Justice Franklin's white shirt was a size too small, grabbing at his neck. 
The yellow silk tie was too loud for his subdued gray suit. Charlotte Kinsey had a quick, 
sweet smile that was irresistible. She had lovely rounded breasts. Her long black hair 
swirled in the river breeze. 


He physically brushed against the two of them. Begot that close to Charlotte and 
Thomas. He actually touched the law student's long shiny hair. He could smell her 
perfume. Opium or Shalimar. 

Snapshot. 

He was right there. So close. He was practically on top of them, in every sense of the 
phrase. 
His mind's eye continued to snap off photo after photo of the two of them. He would 

never forget any of this, not a single frame of the intimate murder scene. 
He could see, hear, touch, smell; and yet he couldn't feel a thing. 
Kevin Hawkins resisted all human impulses now. No pity No guilt. No shame. And no 


mercy The law student carried a leather bag on her left shoulder. It was slightly open, 


just a sliver, just enough. Ah, carefree, casual, careless youth. 
The photojournalist was good with his hands. Still good. Still steady. Still very quick. 
Still one of the best. 


He slid something into her bag. C'est ca. That was it! Success. 


The first of the night. 


Neither she nor Justice Franklin noticed the fleeting movement, or him, as he passed by 


in the crowd. He was the river breeze, the night, the light of the moon. 
He felt incredible exhilaration at that special moment. There was nothing in the world 


like this. The power in taking, stealing, another human life was like nothing else in the 
full palette of human experiences. 
The hard part was over, he knew. The close work. Now the simple act of murder. 
To murder in public view. 
And not get caught. 
His heart suddenly jumped, bucked horribly Something was going wrong. Very wrong. 


As wrong as could be. Wrong, wrong, wrong! 
Jesus, Charlotte Kinsey was reaching into her bag. 
Snapshot. 
She'd found the note he'd left there -- the note from Jack and Jill! 



Wrong, wrong, wrong! 
Snapshot. 
She was looking at it curiously, wondering what it was, wondering how it had gotten in 


her handbag. 


She began to unfold the note, and he could feel his temples pounding horribly She had 
gotten the justice's attention. He glanced down at the note as well. 
Nooooo! Jesus, nooo, he wanted to scream. 
Kevin Hawkins operated on pure instinct. The purest. No time to second-guess himself 


now. 
He moved forward very quickly and surely His Luger was out, dangling below his waist. 


The gun was concealed because of the closeness of the crowd, the forest of legs and arms, 
pleated trousers, fluffed dresses. 
He raised and fired the Luger just once. Tricky angle, too. Far from ideal. He saw the 


sudden blossom of crimson red. The body jolted, then crumbled and fell to the marble 
floor. 
A heartshot! Certainly a miracle, or close to it. God was on his side, no? 
Snapshot! 
Snapshot! 


His heart almost couldn't take it. He wasn't used to this sudden improvising. 
He thought about getting caught, after all of these years, and on such an unbelievably 
important job. He had a vision of total failure. He felt... he felt something. 


He dropped the Luger into the jumble of legs, trousers, satin and taffeta gowns, high-
heeled slippers, highly polished dark cordovans. 
"Was that a gunshot?" a woman shrieked. "Oh, God, Phillip. 


Someone been shot." 
He backed away from the spectacle as just about everyone else did. The Grand Foyer 
looked as if it were ablaze. 



He was part of them, part of the fearful, bolting crowd. He had nothing to do with the 


terrifying disturbance, the murder, the loud gunshot. 
His face was a convincing mask of shock and disbelief. God, he knew this look so well. 
He had seen it so many times before in his lifetime. 


In another tense few moments, he was outside the Kennedy Center. He was heading 


toward New Hampshire Avenue at a steady pace. He was one with the crowd. 
"Seems Like Old Times" raced through his head, playing much too fast, at double or 
triple speed. He remembered humming the tune on his walk in. And as the 
photojournalist knew, the old times were definitely the best. 


The old times were coming back now, weren't they? 
Jack and Jill had come to The Hill. 
The game was so beautiful, so delicate and exquisite. 
Now for the greatest shocker of them all. 
AGENT JAY GRAYER called me at home from his car phone. I was in the middle of 


reading approximately two hundred background security checks done on White House 
personnel by the Secret Service uniformed division. The deputy director was speeding 
downtown to the Kennedy Center complex, doing ninety on the beltway. I could hear the 
siren blaring from his car. 

"They struck again. Jesus, they made a hit at the Kennedy Center tonight. Right under 
our noses. It's another real bad acid trip, Alex. Just come." He definitely sounded out of 
control. 

Just come. 

"They hit during intermission of Miss Saigon. I'll meet you there, Alex. I'm seven to ten 
minutes away" 
"Who was it this time?" I asked the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. I almost didn't 

want to hear the answer. No, not almost. 
I didn't want to hear the victim's name. 
"That's part of the problem. This whole thing is nuts. It wasn't really anybody, Alex." 
"What do you mean, 'it wasn't really anybody'? That doesn't make sense to me, Jay." 



"It was a law student from Georgetown University A young woman named Charlotte 
Kinsey. She was only twenty-three years old. They left one of their notes again. It's 
them for sure." 

"I don't get it. I do not get this," I muttered over the phone. 
"Goddamnit." 
"Neither do I. The girl might have caught a bullet meant for somebody else. She was out 


with a Supreme Court justice, Alex. 
Thomas Henry Franklin. Maybe the bullet was meant for him. 
That would fit the celebrity pattern. Maybe they've finally made a mistake." 
"I'm on my way," I told Jay GraTer. "I'll meet you inside the Kennedy Center." 
Maybe they finally made a mistake. 
I didn't think so. 
IT WASN'TREALLYANYBODY, ALEX. How the hell could that be? 
A twenty-three-year-old law student from Georgetown was dead. Christ. It didn't make 


sense to me, didn't track at all. It changed everything. It seemed to blow the pattern. 
I drove from our home to the Kennedy Center in record time. 
Jay Grayer wasn't the only one partly out of control. I stuck a flasher on the roof of my 


car and rode like hell on wheels. 


The second half of Miss Saigon had been canceled. The murder had taken place less than 
an hour before, and there were still hundreds of onlookers at the crime scene. 
I heard "Jack and Jill" mumbled several times as I made my way to the Grand Foyer. 

Fear was a tangible, almost physical, presence in the crowd. A lot of elements of the 
murder at the Kennedy Center were torturing me when I arrived at the crime scene at 
quarter past ten. There were some similarities with the other Jack and Jill killings. A 
rhyming note had been left. The job had been done coldly and professionally. A single 
shot. 

But there were huge differences this time. They seemed to have destroyed their pattern. 
Copycat killer? Maybe. But I didn't think so. Yet nothing could, or should, be 
dismissed. Not by me, and not by anyone else on the case. 


The new twists nagged at me as I pushed my way through the curious, horrified, even 
dumbstruck, crowd on New Hampshire Avenue. The law student hadn't been a national 
figure. So why had she been killed? Jay Grayer had called her a nobody. Grayer said 
she wasn't the daughter of anybody famous, either. She had been out to the theater with 
Supreme Court Justice Thomas Henry Franklin, but that didn't seem to count as a 
celebrity stalk-and-kill. 

Charlotte Kinsey hadhat would fit the celebrity pattern. Maybe they've finally made a

Charlotte Kinsey had been a nobody. 

The killing just didn't fit the pattern. Jack and Jill had taken a huge risk committing the 
murder in such a public place. The other killings had been private affairs, safer and more 
controllable. 

Shit, shit, shit. What were they up to now? Was this whole thing changing? Escalating? 
Why had they varied their pattern? Were the killers moving into another, more random 
phase? 

Had I missed their original point? Had we all missed the real pattern they were creating? 
Or had they made a mistake at the Kennedy Center? 

Maybe they finally made a mistake. 

That was our best hope. It would show that they weren't invincible. 

Let this be a goddamn mistake! Please let it be their first. 

Just the same, whoever it was made a clever escape. 

The six-hundred-foot-long lobby had been emptied of all but police officials, the medical 
examiner's staff, and the morgue crew. I saw Agent Grayer and walked over to him. Jay 
looked as if he hadn't slept in weeks, as if he might never be able to sleep again. 

"Alex, thanks for getting down here so quickly," the Secret Service agent said. I liked 
working with him so far. He was smart and usually even-tempered, with absolutely no 
bullshit about him. He had an old-fashioned dedication to his job, and especially to the 
President, both the office and the man. 

"Anything worthwhile turn up yet?" I asked him. "Besides another corpse. The poem." 

Grayer rolled his eyes toward the glittering chandeliers hanging above us. "Oh yeah. 
Definitely, Alex. We found out some more about the murdered student. Charlotte 
Kinsey was just starting her second year at Georgetown Law. She was bright as hell, 
apparently. Did her undergraduate at New- York University. 

However, she only had average grades as a Hoya, so she didn't make law Review:" 

"How does a law student fit into the pattern? Unless they were shooting at Justice 
Franklin and actually missed. I've been trying to make some connection on the way over. 
Nothing comes to mind. Except that maybe Jack and Jill are playing with us?" 


Grayer nodded. "They're definitely playing with us. For one thing, your illicit sex theory 
is still intact. We know why Charlotte Kinsey didn't excel at Georgetown. She was 
spending quality time with some very important men here in town. Very pretty girl, as 
you'll see in a second. Shiny black hair down to her waist. 

Great shape. Questionable morals. She'd have made a terrific attorney." 

The two of us walked over to the dead woman's body. The law student was lying facing 
away from us. 

Beside the body was a bag she had been carrying. I couldn't see the bullet hole, and 
Charlotte Kinsey didn't even appear to be hurt. She looked as if she'd just decided to take 
a nap on the floor of the terrace at the Kennedy Center. Her mouth was open slightly, as 
if she wanted one last breath of the river air. 

"Go ahead, tell me now," I said to Jay Grayer. I knew that he had something more on the 
murder. "Who is she?" 

"Oh, she's somebody, after alk The girl was President Byrnes's mistress," he said. "She 
was seeing the President, too. He skipped out of the White House and saw her the other 
night. That's why they killed her. Bingo, Alex. Right in our face." 

My chest felt seriously constricted as I bent over the dead woman. Claustrophobia again. 
She was very pretty. Twenty-three years old. Prime of her life. One shot to the heart had 
ended that. 

I read the note they had left in the law student's handbag. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill Your mistress had no clue, Sir. 

She was a pawn But now she's gone And soon we'll get to you, Sir. 

The poetry seemed to be getting a little better. Certainly it was bolder. And so were Jack 
and Jill. God help us all, but especially President Thomas Byrnes. 

And soon we'll get to you, Sir. 

THE MORNING after the murder, I drove eight miles down to Langley, Virginia. I 
wanted to spend some time with Jeanne Sterling, the CIKs inspector general and the 
Agency's representative on the crisis team. Don Hamerman had made it clear to me that 
the Agency was involved because there was the possibility a foreign power might be 
behind Jack and Jill. Even if it were a long shot, it had to be checked. Somehow, I 
suspected there might be more to the involvement than just that. This was my chance to 
find out. 


Supposedly, the Agency had a lead that was worth checking out. Since the Aldrich Ames 
scandal, and the resulting Intelligence Authorization Act, the CIA had to share 
information with the rest of us. It was now the law. 

I remembered the inspector general very well from our first meeting at the White House. 
Jeanne Sterling had listened mostly, but when she spoke, she was highly articulate and 
spotlight-bright. 

Don Hamerman told me she had been a professor of law at the University of Virginia 
years before joining the Agency Now her job was to help clean up the Agency from the 
inside. It sounded like an impossible task to me, certainly a daunting one. 

Hamerman told me she had been put on the crisis team for one reason: she was the 
Agency's best mind. 

Her office was on the seventh floor of the modern gray building that was the hub of CIA 
headquarters. I checked out the Agency's interior design: lots of extremely narrow halls, 
green-hued fluorescent lighting everywhere, cipher locks on most of the office doors. 
Here it was in all its glory: the CIA, the avenging angel of U.S. foreign policy. 

Jeanne Sterling met me in the gray-carpeted hallway outside her office. "Dr. Cross, thank 
you for coming down here. Next time, I promise we'll do it up in Washington. I thought 
it best if we meet here. I think you'll understand by the time we're finished this morning." 

"Actually, I enjoyed the drive down, needed the escape," I admitted to her. 'Half an hour 
by myself. Cassandra Wilson on the tape deck. 'Blue Light 'Til Dawn." Not so bad." 

"I think I know exactly what you mean. Trust me, though, this won't be a trip in search 
of the wild goose. I have something interesting to discuss with you. The Agency was 
called in on this with good reason, Dr. Cross. You'll see in a moment." 

Jeanne Sterling was certainly far removed from the stereotypical CIA Brahmin of the 
fifties and sixties. She spoke with a folksy, enthusiastic, mid-Southern accent, but she sat 
on the Agency's Directorate of Operations. She was considered crucial to the CIAs 
turnaround; indeed, its very survival. 

We entered her large office, which had a commanding view of woods on two sides and a 
planted courtyard on another. We sat at a low-slung glass table covered with official-
looking papers and books. Photographs of her family were up on the walls. 

Cute kids, I couldn't help noticing. Nice-looking husband, tall and lean. She herself was 
tall, blond, but a little heavier than she ought to be. She had a friendly smile with a slight 
overbite, and just a hint of the farmer's daughter about her. 

"Something important has come up," she said, "but before I get into it, I just heard that 
the gun used at the Kennedy Center wasn't the same one used for the previous murders. 


That raises a question or two; at least, in my mind it does. Could the Kennedy Center 
murder have been a copycat killing?" 

"I don't think so," I said. "Not unless the copycat and Jack or Jill happen to have the 
same handwriting. No, the latest rhyme was definitely from them. I also think it 
qualifies as a celebrity stalking." 

"One more question," Jeanne Sterling said. "This one is completely off the beaten track, 
Alex. So bear with me. Our analysts have been searching, but we're not aware of any 
useful psychological study that's looked at professional assassins. I'm talking about 
studies on the contract killers used by the Army, the DEA, the Agency. Are you aware of 
anything? Even we don't have a comprehensive study on the subject." 

I had a feeling we were easing into what Jeanne Sterling wanted to discuss. Maybe that 
was also why the head of in-terual affairs for the Agency was involved with the crisis 
team. 

Contract killers for the Army and CIA. I knew that they existed and that a few lived in 
the area surrounding Washington. I also knew they were registered somewhere, but not 
with the D.C. police. 

Perhaps for that reason they were sometimes referred to as "ghosts." 

"There's not much written about homicide in any of the psych journals," I told Jeanne 
Sterling. 'A few years back, a professor I know at Georgetown ran an interesting search. 
He found several thousand references to suicide, but less than fifty homicide ref: rences 
in the journals he sampled. I've read a couple of student papers written at John Jay and 
Quantico. There isn't very much on assassins. Not that I'm aware of. I guess it's hard to 
get subjects to interview." 

"I could get a subject for you to interview," Jeanne Sterling said. "I think it might be 
important to Jack and Jill." 

"Where are you going with this?" I had a lot of questions for her suddenly. Familiar 
alarms were sounding inside my head. 

A soft, pained look drifted across her face. She inhaled very slowly before she spoke 
again. "We've done extensive psychological testing on our lethal agents, Alex. So has 
the Army, I've been assured. I've even read some of the test reports myself." 

My stomach continued to tighten. So did my neck and shoulders. 

But I was definitely glad I'd taken the time to visit Langley. 

"Since I've been in this job, about eleven months, I've had to open a number of dark, eerie 
closets here at Langley and !se-where. 


I did over three hundred in-depth interviews on Aldrich Ames alone. You can imagine 
the cover-ups that we've had over the years. Well, you.probably can't. I couldn't have 
myself, and I was working here." 

I still wasn't sure where Jeanne Sterling was going with this. 

She had my full attention, though. 

"We think one of our former contract killers might be out of control. Actually, we're 
pretty sure of it, Alex. That's why the CIA is on the crisis team. We think one of ours 
might be Jack." 

JEANNE STERLING and I went for a ride through the surrounding countryside. The 
CIA inspector general had a new station wagon, a dark blue Volvo that she drove like a 
race car. Brahms was playing softly on the radio as we headed for Chevy Chase, one of 
Washington's small, affluent bedroom communities. I was about to meet a "ghost." A 
professional killer. One of ours. 

Oh brother, oh shit. 

"Plot and counterplot, ruse and treachery, true agent, double agent, false agent... didn't 
Churchill describe your business something like that?" 

Jeanne Sterling cracked a wide smile, her large teeth suddenly very prominent. She was 
a very serious person, but she had a quick sense of humor, too. The inspector general. 
"We're trying to change from the past, both the perception and the reality. 

Either the Agency does that or somebody will pull the plug. 

That's why I invited the FBI and the Washington police in on this. 

I don't want the usual internal investigation, and then charges of a cover-up," she told me 
as she engineered her car underneath towering, ancient trees that evoked Richmond or 
Charlottesville. 

"The CIA is no longer a 'cult,' as we've been called by several selfserving congressmen. 
We're changing everything. Fast. Maybe even too fast." 

"You disapprove?" I asked her. 

"Not at all. It has to happen. I just don't like all the theater surrounding it. And I 
certainly don't appreciate the media coverage. 

What an incredible assemblage of jerk-offs." 


We had crossed inside the beltway and were entering Chevy Chase now. We were 
headed for a meeting with a man named Andrew Klauk. Klauk was a former contract 
killer for the Agency: the so-called killer elite, the "ghosts." 

Jeanne Sterling continued to drive the way she talked, without effort and rapidly. It was 
the way she seemed to do everything. 

A very smart and impressive person. I guess she needed to be. 

Internal affairs at the CIA had to be extremely demanding. 

"So, what have you heard about us, Alex?" she finally asked me. "What's the scuttlebutt? 
The intelligence?" 

"Don Hamerman says you're a straight arrow, and that's what the Agency needs right 
now. He believes Aldrich Ames hurt the CIA even more than we read. He also believes 
Moynihan's 'End of the Cold War' bill was an American tragedy He says they call you 
Clean Jeanne out here at Langley Your own people do. He's a big fan of yours." 

Jeanne Sterling smiled, but the smile was controlled. She was a woman very much in 
control of herself: intellectually, emotionally, and even physically She was substantial 
and sturdy, and her striking amber eyes always seemed to want to dig a little deeper into 
you. She wasn't satisfied with surface appearances or answers: the mark of a good 
investigator. 

"I'm not really such a goody-goody" She made a pouty face. 

"I was a pretty fair caseworker in Budapest my first two years. 

Caseworker is our sobriquet for 'spy,' Alex. I was a spy in Europe. 

Harmless stuff, information-gathering mostly 

"After that I was at the War College. Fort McBain. My father is career Army. Lives 
with my mother in Arlington. They both voted for Oliver North. I fervently believe in 
our form of government. 

I'm also hooked on making it work better somehow. I think we actually can. I'm 
convinced of it." 

"That sounds pretty good to me," I told her. It did. All except the Oliver North part. 

We were just pulling up to a house that was very close to Connecticut Avenue and the 
Circle. The place was Colonial revival, three stories, very homey and nice. Beautiful. 
Attractive moss crawled over the hipped roof and down the north side. 


"This is where you live?" I smiled at Jeanne. "But you're not Miss Goody Two-shoes? 
You're not Clean Jeanne?" 

"Right. It's all a clever facade, Alex. Like Disneyland, or Williamsburg, or the White 
House. To prove it to you, there a trained killer waiting for us inside," Jeanne Sterling 
said, and winked. 

"There's one in your car, too." I winked back at her. 

THE LATE-DECEMBER AFTERNOON was unusually bright and sunny The 
temperature was in the high fifties, so Andrew Klauk and I sat in the backyard at Jeanne 
Sterling's lovely home in Chevy Chase. 

A simple, wrought-iron fence surrounded the property. The gate was forest green, 
recently painted, slightly ajar. A breech in security. 

CIA hitmen. Killer elite. Ghosts. They do exist. More than two hundred of them, 
according to Jeanne Sterling. A freelance list. A weird, scary notion for the 1990s in 
America. Or anywhere else, for that matter. 

And yet here I was with one of them. 

It was past three when Andrew Klauk and I began our talk. 

A bright yellow school bus stopped by the fence, dropping off kids on the quiet suburban 
street. A small towheaded boy of ten or eleven came running up the driveway and into 
the house. I thought that I recognized the boy from the photos at her office. 

Jeanne Sterling had a boy and a little girl. Just like me. She brought her casework home, 
just like me. Scary. 

Andrew Klauk was a whale of a man who looked as if he could move very well, anyway. 
A whale who dreamed of dane-in. 

He was probably about forty-five years old. He was calm and extremely self-assured. 
Piercing brown eyes that grabbed and wouldn't let go. Penetrated deeply. He wore a 
shapeless gray suit with an open-neck white shirt that was wrinkled and dingy. 

Brown Italian leather shoes. Another kind of killer, but a killer all the same, I was 
thinking. 

Jeanne Sterlin had raised a very provocative question for me on our drive: What was the 
difference between the serial killers I had pursued in the past and the contract killers used 
by the CIA and Army? Did I think one of these sanctioned killers could actually be Jack 
of Jack and Jill? 


She did. She was certain that it was a possibility that needed to be checked out, and not 
just by her own people. 

I studied Klauk as the two of us talked in a casual, sometimes even lighthearted, manner. 
It wasn't the first time I'd conversed like that with a man who murdered for a living, with 
a mass murderer, so to speak. This killer, however, was allowed to go home nights to his 
family in Falls Church, and lead what he described as a "normal, rather guilt-free life." 

As Andrew Klauk told me at one point: "I've never committed a crime in my life, Dr. 
Cross. Never got a speeding ticket." Then he laughed -- a bit inappropriately, I thought. 
He laughed a little too hard. 

"What's so funny?" I asked him. "Did I miss something?" 

"You're what, two hundred pounds, six foot four? That about right?" 

"Pretty close," I told him. "Six three. A little under two hundred. 

But who's counting?" 

"Obviously, I am, Detective. I'm grossly overweight and look out of shape, but I could 
take you out right here on the patio," he informed me. It was a disturbing observation on 
his part, provocatively stated. 

Whether or not he could do it, he needed to tell me. That was the way his mind worked. 
Good to know. He'd succeeded in shaking me up a little just the same, in making me 
extra cautious. 

"You might be surprised," I said to him, "but I'm not sure if I get the point you're trying to 
make." 

He laughed again, a tiny, unpleasant nose snort. Scary guy to drink lemonade with. 
"That's the point. I could and I would, if it was asked of me by our country. That's what 
you don't get about the Agency, and especially about men and women in my position," he 
said. 

"Help me to get it," I said. "I don't mean you should try to kill me here in the Sterlings' 
backyard, but keep talking." 

His tight smile turned to a wide-open grin. "Not try. Trust me on that one." 

He was a truly scary man. He reminded me a little of a psychopathic killer named Gary 
Soneji. I had talked to Soneji just like this. Neither of them had much affect in their 
faces. Just this cold fixed glare that wouldn't go away. Then sudden bursts of laughter. 

My skin was crawling. I wanted to get up from the table and leave. 


Klauk stared at me for a long moment before he went on. I could hear Jeanne Sterling's 
kids inside the house. The refrigerator door opening and closing. Ice tinkling against 
glass. Birds whooping and twittering in background trees. It was a strange, strange 
scene. Indescribably eerie for me. 

"There is one basic proposition in covert action. In subversion, sabotage, being better at 
it than the other guy. We can do anything we want." Klauk said it very, very slowly, 
word by word. 

"And we often do. You're a psychologist and a homicide detective, right? What's your 
objective take on this? What are you hearing from me?" 

"No rules," I said to him. "That's what you're telling me. You live, you work, in a closed 
world that virtually isn't governed. 

You could say that your world is completely antisocial." 

He snorted a laugh again. I was a decent student, I guess. "Not a fucking one of them. 
Once we're commissioned for a job -- there are no rules. Not a one. Think about it." 

I definitely would think about it. I started right then and there. 

I considered the idea of Klauk trying to kill me -- if our country asked him to. No rules. 
A world peopled by ghosts. And even scarier was that I could sense he believed every 
word he'd said. 

After I finished with Klauk, for that afternoon at least, I talked with Jeanne Sterling for a 
while more. We sat in an idyllic, multiwindowed sunroom that looke said. "I don't mean 
you should try to kill me here in the Sterlings' backyard, but keep talking." 

His tight smile turned to a wide-open grin. "Not try. Trust me on that one." 

He was a truly scary man. He reminded me a little of a psychopathic killer named Gary 
Soneji. I had talked to Soneji just like this. Neither of them had much affect in their 
faces. Just this cold fixed glare that wouldn't go away. Then sudden bursts of laughter. 

My skin was crawling. I wanted to get up from the table and leave. 

Klauk stared at me for a long moment before he went on. I could hear Jeanne Sterling's 
kids inside the house. The refrigerator door opening and closing. Ice tinkling against 
glass. Birds whooping and twittering in background trees. It was a strange, strange 
scene. Indescribably eerie for me. 


"There is one basic proposition in covert action. In subversion, sabotage, being better at 
it than the other guy. We can do anything we want." Klauk said it very, very slowly, 
word by word. 

"And we often do. You're a psychologist and a homicide detective, right? What's your 
objective take on this? What are you hearing from me?" 

"No rules," I said to him. "That's what you're telling me. You live, you work, in a closed 
world that virtually isn't governed. 

You could say that your world is completely antisocial." 

He snorted a laugh again. I was a decent student, I guess. "Not a fucking one of them.

I definitely would think about it. I started right then and there. 

I considered the idea of Klauk trying to kill me -- if our country asked him to. No rules. 
A world peopled by ghosts. And even scarier was that I could sense he believed every 
word he'd said. 

After I finished with Klauk, for that afternoon at least, I talked with Jeanne Sterling for a 
while more. We sat in an idyllic, multiwindowed sunroom that looked out on the idyllic 
backyard. The subject of conversation continued to be murder. I hadn't come down yet 
from my talk with the assassin. The ghost. 

"What did you think of our Mr. Klauk?" Jeanne asked me. 

"Disturbed me. Irritated me. Scared the hell out of me," I admitted to her. "He's really 
unpleasant. Not nice. He's a jerk, 

"An incredible asshole," she agreed. Then she didn't say anything for a couple of 
seconds. "Alex, somebody inside the Agency has killed at least three of our agents. 
That's one of the skeletons I've dug up so far in my time as inspector. It's an 'unsolved 
crime." The killer isn't Klauk, though. Andrew is actually under control. 

He isn't dangerous. Somebody else is. To tell you the complete truth, the Directorate of 
Operations has demanded that we bring in somebody from the outside on this. We 
definitely think one of our contract killers could be Jack. Who knows, maybe Jill is one 
of ours, too." 

I didn't talk for a moment, just listened to what Jeanne Sterling had to say. Jack and Jill 
came to The Hill. Could Jack be a trained assassin? What about Jill? And then, why 
were they killing celebrities in Washington? Why had they threatened President Byrnes? 


My mind whirled around in great looping circles. I thought about all the possibilities, the 


connections, and also the disconnects. 
Two renegade contract killers on the loose. It made as much sense as anything else I had 
heard so far. It explained some things about Jack and Jill for me, especially the absence 
of passion or rage in the murders. Why were they killing politicians and celebrities, 
though? Had they been commissioned to do the job? If so, by whom? To what end? 
What was their cause? 


"Let me ask you a burning question, Jeanne. Something else has been bothering me since 
we got here." 
"Go ahead, Alex. I want to try and answer a]l your questions. 


If I can, that is." 
"Why did you bring him here to talk? Why take Andrew Klauk right into your own 
house?" 


"It was a safe place for the meeting," she said without any hesitation. 


She sounded so unbelievably certain when she said it. I felt a chill ease up my spine. 
Then Jeanne Sterling sighed loudly. 
She knew what I was getting at, what I was feeling, as I sat inside her home. 
"Alex, he knows where I live. Andrew Klauk could come here if he wanted to. Any of 


them can." 


I nodded and left it at that. I knew the feeling exactly; I lived with it. It was my single 
greatest fear as an investigator. My worst nightmare. 
They know where we live. 
They can come to our houses if they want to... anytime they want to. 
Nobody was safe anymore. 
There are no rules. 
There are "ghosts" and human monsters, and they are very real in our lives. Especially in 


my life. 
There was Jack and Jill. 
There was the Sojourner Truth School killer. 



AT A LITTLE PAST SEVEN the next morning, I sat across from Adele Finaly and 
unloaded everything that I possibly could on her. I unloaded -- period. Dr. Adele Finaly 
has been my analyst for a half-dozen years, and I see her on an irregular basis. As 
needed. Like right now. She's also a good friend. 

I was ranting and raving a little bit. This was the place for it, though. "Maybe I want to 
leave the force. Maybe I don't want to be part of any more vile homicide investigations. 
Maybe I want to get out of Washington, or at least out of Southeast. Or maybe I want to 
trot down and see Kate McTiernan in West Virginia. 

Take a sabbatical at just about the worst possible time for one." 

"Do you really want to do any of those things?" Adele asked when I had finished, or at 
least had quieted down for a moment. 

"Or are you just venting?" 

"I don't know, Adele. Probably venting. There's also a woman I met whom i could 
become interested in. She's married," I said and smiled. "I'd never do anything with a 
married woman, so she's perfectly safe for me. She couldn't be safer. I think I'm 
regressing." 

"You want an opinion on that, Alex? Well, I can't give you one. 

You certainly have a lot on your plate, though." 

"I'm right smack in the middle of a very bad homicide investigation. 

Two of them, actually. I just came off another particularly disturbing one. I think I can 
sort that part out for myself. 

But, you know, it's funny. I suspect that I still want to please my mother and father, and 
it can't be done. i can't get over the feeling of abandonment. Can't intellectualize it. 
Sometimes I feel that both my parents died of a kind of terminal sadness, and that my 
brothers and I were part of their sorrow. I'm afraid that I have it, too. I think that my 
mother and father were probably as smart as I am, and that they must have suffered 
because of it." My mother and father had died in North Carolina, at a very young age. 
My father had killed himself with liquor, and I hadn't really gotten over it. My mom died 
of lung cancer the year before my father. 

Nana Mama had taken me in when I was nine years old. 

"You think sadness can be in the genes, Alex? I don't know what to think about that 
myself. Did you see that New Yorker piece on twins by any chance? There's some 
evidence for the genes theory. Scary note for our profession." 


"Detective work?" I asked her. 

Adele didn't comment on my little joke. 

"Sorry," I said. "Sorry, sorry." 

"You don't have to be sorry. You know how happy it makes me when you get any of 
your anger out." 

She laughed. We both did. I like talking to her because our sessions can bounce around 
like that, laughter to tears, serious to absurd, truth to lies, just about anything and 
everything that's bothering me. Adele Finaly is three years younger than I am, but she's 
wise beyond her years, and maybe my years as well. Seeing her for a skull session works 
even better than playing the blues on my front porch. 

I talked some more, let my tongue wag, let my mind run free, and it felt pretty good. It's 
a wonderful thing to have somebody in your life whom you can say absolutely anything 
to. Not to have that is almost unthinkable to me. 

"Here's a connection I've made recently," I told Adele. "Maria is murdered. I grieve and 
I grieve, but I never come close to getting over the loss. Just luck I've never gotten past 
the loss of my mother and father." 

Adele nods. "It's incredibly hard to find a soul mate." She knows. She's never been able 
to find one herself, which is sad. 

"And it's hard to lose one -- a soul mate. So, of course, now I'm petrified about losing 
anyone else whom I care deeply for. I shy away from relationships -- because they might 
end in loss. I don't leave my job with the police -- because that would be a kind of loss, 
too." 

"But you're thinking about these things a lot now." 

"All the time, Adele. Something's going to happen." 

"Something has. We've run way over our time," Adele finally said. 

"Good," I said and laughed again. Some people turn on Comedy Central for a good 
laugh. I go to my shrink. 

"Lots of hostility How nice for you. I don't think you're regressing, Alex. I think you're 
doing beautifully" 

"God, I love talking to you," I told her. "Let's do this in a month or so, when I'm really 
screwed up again." 


"I can't wait," Adele said and rubbed her small, thin hands together greedily "In the 
meantime, as Bart Simpson has said many times, 'Don't have a cow, man."" 

DETECTIVE JOHN SAMPSON couldn't remember working so many brutal, absolutely 
shitty days in a row. He couldn't remember it ever being so godawful, goddamn bad. He 
had an overload of really bad homicides and he had the Sojourner Truth School killer 
case, which didn't seem to be going anywhere. 

On the morning after the Kennedy Center killing, Sampson worked the upscale side of 
Garfield Park, the "west bank." He was keeping his eyes out for Alex's homeless suspect, 
who'd been spotted the afternoon of Shanelie Green's murder, though not since, so even 
that lead was growing cold. Alex had a simple formula for thinking about complex cases 
like this one. First, you had to answer the question that everybody had: What kind of 
person would do something like this? What kind of nutcase? 

He had decided to visit the Theodore Roosevelt School on his street canvass. The 
exclusive military academy used Garfield Park for its athletics and some paramilitary 
maneuvers. There was a slim possibility that a sharp-eyed cadet had seen something. 

A white-haired homeless motherfucker, Sampson thought as he climbed the military 
school's front graystone steps. A sloppy and disorganized thrill killer who left 
fingerprints and other clues at both crime scenes, and still nobody could nail his candyass 
to the wall. 

Every single clue leads to a dead end. 

Why was that? What were we getting all wrong here? What were they messing up on? 
Not just him. Alex and the rest of the posse, too. 

Sampson went looking for the commandant at the school, The Man In Charge. The 
detective had served four years in the Army, two of them in Vietnam, and the pristine 
school brought to mind ROTC lieutenants in the war. Most of them had been white. 
Several had died needlessly, in his opinion -- a couple of them, his friends. 

The Theodore Roosevelt School consisted of four extremely well-kept, red-brick 
buildings with steep, slate-shingle roofs. 

Two of the roofs had chimneys spouting soft curls of gray smoke. 

Everything about the place shouted "structure," 

"order," and "dead, white louies" to him. 

Imagine something like this school, only in Southeast around the projects, he thought as 
he continued his solitary walk around the school. The image made him smile. He could 


almost see five hundred or so homies resplendent in their royal blue dress uniforms, their 
spit-shined boots, their plumed dress hats. Really something to contemplate. Might even 
do some good. 

"Sir, can I help you?" A scrawny towheaded cadet came up to him as he started down 

what looked to be an academic hall in one of the buildings. 
"You on guard here?" Sampson asked in a soft drawl that was the last vestige of a mother 
who'd grown up in Alabama. 


The toy soldier shook his head. "No, sir. But can I help you anyway?" 


"Washington police," Sampson said. "I need to speak with whoever's in charge. Can 
You arrange that, soldier?" 
"Yes, sir!" 
The cadet saluted him, of all people, and Sampson had to fight back the day's first, and 


maybe only, smile. 
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED scrubbed and steampressed cadets from the middle 


school and the academy's high school were crammed into Lee Hall at nine o'clock in the 
morning. 
The cadets wore their regular school uniform: loose-fitting gray pants, black shirt and tie, 


gray waist-jacket. 
From his stiff wooden seat in the school auditorium, the Sojourner Truth School killer 


saw the towering black man entering Lee Hall. He recognized him instantly That sucker 
was Detective John Sampson. He was Alex Cross's friend and partner. 
This was not a good thing. This was very bad, in fact. The killer immediately began to 

panic, to experience the outer edges of fear. 
He wondered if the Metro police were coming for him right now. 
Did they know who he was? 
He wanted to run -- but there was no way out of here now. 
He had to sit this one out, to gut it out. 
The killer's initial reaction was to feel shame. He thought he was going to be sick. 


Throw up or something. He wanted to put his head between his legs. He felt like such a 
chump to get caught like this. 


He was seated about twenty yards from where that stuffed shirt Colonel Wilson and the 
detective were standing around as if something incredibly fucking important were about 
to happen. 

Every passing cadet saluted the adults, like the robotic morons that they were. A buzz of 
apprehension began to fill the room. 

Was something earth-shattering going to happen? The thought screaming inside the 
killer's head. Were the police about to arrest him in front of the entire school? Had he 
been caught? 

How could they have traced anything to him, though? It didn't make sense. That thought 
calmed him somewhat. 

A false calm? A false sense of security? he wondered and lowered himself slightly in 
the stiff wooden seat, wishing that somehow he could disappear. 

Then he sat straight up in his seat again. Oh, shit. Here we go! 

He watched closely as the homicide detective slowly walked toward the podium with 
Colonel Wilson. His heartbeat was like the rhythm section in a White Zombie song. 

The assembly began with the usual, dumb cadet resolutions, "honesty, integrity in 
thought and deed," all that crap. Then Colonel Wilson began to talk about the "cowardly 
murders of two children in Garfield Park." Wilson went on: "The Metro police are 
canvassing the park and surrounding environs. Maybe a cadet at Theodore Roosevelt has 
unwittingly seen something that might help the police with their investigation. Maybe 
one of you can help the police in some way." 

So that was why the imposing homicide detective was here. A goddamn fishing 
expedition. The ongoing frigging investigation of the two murders. 

The killer was still holding his breath, though. His eyes were very large and riveted to 
the stage as Sampson went over to the podium mike. The tall black man really stood out 
in the room of nothing but uniforms and short haircuts and mostly pink faces. 

He was huge. He was also kind of cool-looking in his black leather car coat, gray shirt, 
black necktie. He towered over the podium, which had seemed just the right height for 
Colonel Wilson. 

"I served in Vietnam, under a couple of lieutenantswho looked about your age," the 
detective said into the mike. His voice was calm and very deep. He laughed then, and so 
did most of the cadets. 


He had a lot of presence, a whole world of presence. He definitely seemed like the real 
deal. The killer thought that Sampson was laughing down at the cadets, but he couldn't 
be sure. 

"The reason I'm here at your school this morning," the detective went on, "is that we're 
canvassing Garfield Park and everything that it touches. Two little kids were savagely 
killed there, both within the past week. The skulls of the children were crushed. The 
killer is a fiend, in no uncertain terms." 

The killer wanted to give Sampson the finger. The killer isn't a fiend. You're the fiend, 
mojoman. The killer is a lot cooler than you think. 

"As I understand it from Colonel Wilson, many of you go home from school through the 
park. Others run cross-country, and you also play soccer and lacrosse in the park. I'm 
going to leave my number at the precinct with the office here at school. 

You can contact me at any time, day or night, at the number if you've seen anything that 
could be helpful to us." 

The Sojourner Truth School killer couldn't take his eyes off the towering homicide 
detective who spoke so very calmly and confidently. He wondered if he could possibly be 
a match for this one. Not to mention motherhumping Detective Alex Cross, who 
reminded him of his own real father -- a cop. 

He thought that he could be a match for them. 

"Does anybody have any questions?" Sampson asked from the stage. "Any questions at 
all? This is the time for it. This is the place. Speak up, young men." 

The killer wanted to shout from his seat. He had an overwhelming impulse to throw his 
right arm high in the air and volunteer some real help. He finally sat on his hands, right 
on his fingers. 

I unwittingly saw something in Garfield Park, sir. I might just know who killed those 
two kids with an eighteen-inch, tape-reinforced baseball bat. 

Actually, to be truthful, I killed them, sir. I'm the child killer, you feeble asshole! Catch 
me if you can. 

You're bigger. You're much bigger. But I'm so much smarter than you could ever be. 

I'm only thirteen years old. I'm already this good!Just wait until I get a little older. Chew 
on that, you dumb bastards. 

PART 4 


A-HUNTING WE WILL GO 

I LAY ON THE COUCH with Rosie the cat and a full sack of nightmares. 

Rosie was a beautiful, reddish brown Abyssinian. She was wonderfully athletic, 
independent, feral, and also a great nuzzler. 

She reminded me of the much larger cats of Africa in the way she moved. One weekend 
morning she just showed up at the house, liked it, and stayed. 

"You're not going to leave us one day, are you, Rosie? Leave us like you came?" Rosie 
shook her whole body "What a dopey question," she was telling me. "No, absolutely not. 
I'm part of this family now." 

I couldn't sleep. Even Rosie's purring didn't relax me. I was a few aches beyond bone-
tired, but my mind was racing badly I was counting murders, not sheep. About ten 
o'clock I decided to go for a drive to clear my head. Maybe get in touch with my chi 
energy. Maybe get a sharper insight into one of the murder cases. 

I drove with the car windows open. It was minus three degrees outside. 

I didn't know exactly where I was going -- and yet unconsciously, I did know. Shrink 
shrinks shrink. 

Both murder cases were running hard and fast inside my head. 

They were on dangerous parallel tracks. I kept reviewing and re-reviewing my talk with 
the CIA contract killer Andrew Klauk. I was trying to connect what he'd said to the Jack 
and Jill murders. 

Could one of the "ghosts" be Jack? 

I found myself on New York Avenue, which is also Route 30 and eventually turns into 
the John Hanson Highway. Christine Johnson lived out this way, on the far side of the 
beltway in Prince Georges County. I knew where Christine lived. I'd looked it up in the 
casenotes of the first detective who interviewed her after Shanelle Green's murder. 

This is a crazy thing, I thought as I drove in the direction of her town -- Mitchellville. 

Earlier that night, I'd talked to Damon about how things were going at school now, and 
then about the teachers there. I eventually got around to the principal. Damon saw 
through my act like the little Tasmanian devil that he is sometimes. 

"You like her, don't you?" he asked me, and his eyes lit up like twin beacons. "You do, 
don't you, Daddy? Everybody does. 


Even Nana does. She says Mrs. Johnson is your type. You like her, right?" 

"There's nothing not to like about Mrs. Johnson," I said to Damon. "She's married, 
though. Don't forget that." 

"Don't you forget," Damon said and laughed like Sampson. 

And now here I was driving through the suburban neighborhood relatively late at night. 
What in hell was I doing? What was I thinking of? Had I been spending so much time 
around madmen that finally some of it rubbed off? Or was I actually following one of 
my better instincts? 

I spotted Summer Street and made a quick right turn. There was a mild squeal of tires 
that pierced the perfect quiet of the neighborhood. I had to admit it was beautiful out in 
subur-bia, even at night. The streets were all lit up. Lots of Christmas lights and 
expensive holiday props. There were wide curbs for rain runoff. White sidewalks. 
Colonial-style lampposts on all the street corners. 

I wondered if it was hard for Christine Johnson to leave this safe, lovely enclave to come 
to work in Southeast every day. I wondered what her personal demons were. I wondered 
why she worked such long hours. And what her husband was like. 

Then I saw Christine Johnson's dark blue car in the driveway of a large, brick-faced 
Colonial home. My heart jumped a little. 

Suddenly, everything became very real for me. 

I continued up the blacktop street until I was well past her house. Then I pulled oveve 
who interviewed her after Shanelle Green's murder. 

This is a crazy thing, I thought as I drove in the direction of her town -- Mitchellville. 

Earlier that night, I'd talked to Damon about how things were going at school now, and

Then I saw Christine Johnson's dark blue car in the driveway of a large, brick-faced 
Colonial home. My heart jumped a little. 

Suddenly, everything became very real for me. 

I continued up the blacktop street until I was well past her house. Then I pulled over 
against the curb and shut off the headlights. Tried to shut down the roaring inside my 
head. I stared at the rear of somebody's shiny white Ford Explorer parked out on the 
street. I stared for a good ninety seconds, about how long the white Explorer would have 
lasted before it was stolen on the streets of D.C. 

I had the conscious thought that maybe this was not such a good idea. Doctor Cross didn't 
exactly approve of Doctor Cross's actions. This was real close to being inappropriate 
behavior. Parking in the dark in a posh, suburban neighborhood like this wasn't a real 
sound concept, either. 

A few therapist jokes were running around inside my head. 

Learn to dread one day at a time. You're still having a lousy childhood. 

If you're really happy, you must be in denial. 

"Just go home," I said out loud in the darkened car. "Just say no." 

I continued to sit in the darkness, though, listening to the occasional theatrical sigh, the 
loud debate buzzing inside my head. 

I could smell pine trees and smoke from someone's chimney through the open car 
window. My engine was clicking gently as it cooled. I knew a little about the 
neighborhood: successful lawyers and doctors, urban planners, professors from the 
University of Maryland, a few retired officers from Andrews Air Force Base. 


Very nice and very secure. No need for a dragonslayer out here. 
All right then, go see her. Go see both of them, Christine and her husband. 
I supposed that I could bluff my way through some trumped up reason why I had to come 


out to Mitchellville. I had the gift of gab when I needed it. 
I started the car again, the old Porsche. I didn't know what I was going to do, which way 


this was going to lead. I took my foot off the brake, and the automobile crept along on its 
own. slowly, I crept. 
I continued for a full block like that, listening to the crunch of a few leaves under the 

tires, the occasional pop of a small stone. 
Every noise seemed very loud and magnified to me. 
I finally stopped in front of the Johnson house. Right in front. 
I noticed the bristle&brush, manicured lawn, and well-trimmed yews. 
Moment of truth. Moment of decision. Moment of crisis. 
I could see lights burning brightly inside the house, tiny fires. 
Somebody seemed to be up at the Johnson house. The dark blue Mercedes sedan was 


sitting peacefully against the closed garage door. 
She has a nice car and a beautiful home. Christine Johnson doesn't need any terrible 


trouble from you. Don't bring your monsters out here. She has a lawyer husband. She's 
doing real fine for herself. 
What did she say her husband's name was -- George? George the lawyer lobbyist. 


George the rich lawyer lobbyist. 
There was only one car in the driveway. Her car. The garage door was closed. I could 


picture another car in there, maybe a Lexus. Maybe a gas grill for cookouts, too. Power 
lawn mower, leaf blower, maybe a couple of mountain bikes for weekend fun. 
I shut off the engine and got out of my car. 
The dragonslayer comes to Mitchellville. 
I WAS DEFINITELY CURIOUS about Christine Johnson, and maybe it was a little more 


complicated than that. You like her, don't you, Daddy? Maybe? Yes, I did like her -- a 


lot. At any rate, I felt as if I needed to see her, even if it made me feel tremendously 


awkward and foolish. A good thought struck me as I climbed out of the car: how much 
more foolish to walk away. 

Besides, Christine Johnson was part of the complex homicide case I was working on. 
There was a logical enough reason for me to want to talk to her. Two students from her 
school had been murdered so far. Two of her babies. Why that school? Why had a killer 
come there? So close to my home? 

I walked to the front door and was actually glad that all the shimmering houselights were 
turned on bright. I didn't want her husband, or any of the neighbors in Mitchellville, to 
spot me approaching the house in a cloak of shadows and darkness. 

I rang the bell, heard melodious chimes, and waited like a porch sculpture. A dog barked 
loudly somewhere inside the house. Then Christine Johnson appeared at the front door. 

She had on faded jeans, a wrinkled yellow crewneck sweater, white half-socks, and no 
shoes. A tortoise shell comb pulled her hair back to one side, and she was wearing her 
glasses. She looked as if she were working at home. Still working at this late hour. 

Peas in a pod, weren't we? Well, not exactly. I was a long way from my pod, actually. 

"Detective Cross?" She was surprised; understandably so. I was kind of surprised to be 
standing there myself. 

"Nothing has happened on the case," I quickly reassured her. 

"I just have a few more questions." That was true. Don't lie to her, Alex. Don't you dare 
lie to her. Not even once. Not ever. 

She smiled then. Her eyes seemed to smile as well. They were very large and very 
brown, and I had to stop staring at them immediately. "You do work too late, too hard, 
even under the current circumstances," she said. 

"I couldn't turn this horrible thing off tonight. There are two cases, actually. So here I 
am. If this is a bad time, I'll stop by at the school tomorrow. That's no problem." 

"No, come on in," she said. "I know how busy you are. I can imagine. Come in, please. 
The house is a mess, like our government, all the usual boilerplate copy applies." 

She led me back through an entrance way with a cream marble floor and past the living 
room with its comfortable-looking sectional sofa and lots of earth colors: sienna, ocher, 
and burnt umber. 

There was no guided tour, though. No more questions about why I was there. A little too 
much silence suddenly. My chi energy was draining off somewhere. 


She took me into the huge kitchen. She went to the refrigerator, a big, double-door 
jobbie that opened with a loud whoosh. 

"Let me see, we've got beer, diet cola, sun tea. I can make coffee or hot tea if you'd like. 
You do work too hard. That's for sure." 

She sounded a little like a teacher now. Understanding, but gently reminding me that I 
might have areas of improvement. 

"A beer sounds pretty good," I told her. I glanced around the kitchen, which was easily 
twice the size of ours at home. There were rows of white custom cabinets. A skylight in 
the ceiling. A flyer on the fridge promoting a "Walk for the Homeless." She had a very 
nice home -- she and George did. 

I noted an embroidered cloth on a wall stretcher. Swahili words: Kwenda mzuri. It's a 
farewell that means "go well." A gentle hint? Word to the wise? 

"I'm glad to hear you'll have a beer," she said smiling. "That would mean you're at least 
close to knocking off for the day. It's almost ten-thirty. Did you know that? What time 
is it on your clock?" 

"Is it that late? I'm real sorry," I said to her. "We can do this tomorrow." 

Christine brought me a Heineken and iced tea for herself. 

She sat across from me at an island counter that subdivided the kitchen. The house was 
far from being the mess she'd warned me about when I came in. It was nicely lived-in. 
There was a sweet, charming display of drawings from the Truth School on one wall. 

A beautiful mud cloth on a stretcher also grabbed my eye. 

"So. What's up, doc?" she asked. "What brings you outside the beltway?" 

"Honestly? I couldn't sleep. I took a drive. I drove out this way. Then I had the bright 
idea that maybe we could cover some ground on the case... or maybe I just needed to talk 
to somebody." 

I finally confessed, and it felt pretty good. Directionally good, anyway. 

"Well, that's okay. That's fine. I can relate to that. I couldn't sleep myself," she said. 
"I've been wound tight ever since Shanelle's murder. And then poor Vernon Wheatley. I 
was pruning the plants, with ER on the television for background noise. Pretty pathetic, 
don't you think?" 

"Not really. I don't think it's so strange. ER is good. By the way, you have a beautiful 
house out here." 


I could see the living room TV set from the kitchen. A mammoth Sony playing the 
medical drama. A black retriever, a young dog, wandered in from the direction of a 
narrow hallway with oatmeal-colored carpeted stairs. "That's Meg," Christine told me. 

"She was watching ER, too. Meg loves a good melodrama." The dog nuzzled me, then 
licked my hand. 

I don't know why I wanted to tell her, but I did. 

"I play the piano at night sometimes. There's a sun porch in our house, so the awful 
racket doesn't bother the kids too much. 

Either that or they've learned to sleep right through it," I said. "A little Gershwin, 
Brahms, Jellyroll Morton at one in the morning never hurt anyone." 

Christine Johnson smiled, and seemed at ease with this kind of talk. She was a very self-
assured person, very centered. I'd noticed that right from the first night. I had sensed it 
about her. 

"Damon has mentioned your nocturnal piano playing a few times at school. You know, 
he occasionally brags about you to the teachers. He's a very nice boy, in addition to 
being a brainiac. We like him tremendously" 

"Thank you. I like him a lot myself. He's lucky we have the Sojourner Truth School 
nearby" 

"Yes, I think he is," Christine agreed. "A lot of D.C. schools are a complete disgrace, 
and so sad. The Truth is a small miracle for the children who attend." 

"Your miracle?" I asked her. 

"No, no, no. A lot of people are responsible, least of all me. My husband's law firm has 
contributed some guilt money I just help to keep the miracle going. I believe in miracles, 
though. How long has it been since your wife died, Alex?" she suddenly changed gears. 
But Christine Johnson made the question conversational and low-key and very natural to 
ask, even if it wasn't. Still, it took me by surprise. I sensed I didn't have to answer if I 
didn't want to. 

"It's going to be five years soon," I told her, partly holding my breath as I did. "This 
March, actually Jannie was still a little baby She was less than a year old. I remember 
coming in and holding her that night. She had no idea that she was comforting me." 

The two of us were getting comfortable talking at the kitchen counter. We were both 
opening up quite a lot. Small talk at first. Then bigger talk. Sojourner Truth School 


killer talk. Maybe something helpful for the investigation. It went on like that until 
almost midnight. 

I finally told her I needed to be heading home. She didn't disagree. 

The look in her eyes told me that she understood everything that had gone on here 
tonight, and all of it was okay with her. 

At the front door, Christine surprised me again. She pecked me on the cheek. 

"Come back, Alex," she said, "if you need to talk again. I'll be here tending to my shrubs 
in my ostentatious house. Kwenda mzuri," she said. 

We left it like that. Go well. A strange tableau at a strange time in our lives. I had no 
idea whether her lawyer husband was home or not. Was he up in the bedroom sleeping? 
Was his name really George? Were they still together? 

It was another mystery to solve some other day, but not that day. 

On the drive home, I pondered whether I should feel bad about the unconventional, 
surprise visit to Christine Johnson's house. I decided that I shouldn't, that I wouldn't even 
get embarrassed about it at a later date. She'd made that possible for me. She was 
incredibly easy to be around. Absolutely incredible. 

It was painful in a way When I got home, I played the piano for another hour or so. 

Beethoven, then Mozart. Classical felt right to me. I went up and peeked in on Damon 
andJannie. I gently pecked their cheeks, as Christine Johnson had pecked mine. I finally 
fell asleep on the downstairs couch. I didn't feel sorry for myself there, but I did feel very 
alone. 

I slept until several shrill rings of the phone woke me, shooting adrenaline through my 
body like electric current. 

It was Jack and Jill again. 

TYSONS GALLERIA in Tysons Corner was, along with the neighboring Tysons Comer 
Mall, one of the largest shopping complexes in the United States, maybe in the world. 
Sam Harrison had parked in the enormous Galleria lot at a little past 6:00 At least a 
hundred cars were already there, though Versace and Neiman Marcus, FAO Schwarz and 
Tiljengrist wouldn't open until ten. Maryland Bagels was open and smells from the 
popular local bakery filled the air. Jack hadn't come to Tysons Corner for a piping-hot 
blueberry bagel, though. 

From the parking area of the mall, he jogged to Chain Bridge Road in McLean. He wore 
a blue and white Fila jacket and running shorts and looked as if he belonged in the 


$400,000-to-$1,500,000-per-house neighborhood. That was one of the important rules in 


his game: Always appear to belong, to fit in, and soon you will. 
With his short blond hair and trim build, he looked as if he might be a commercial pilot 
with USAir or Delta. Or perhaps just one of the neighborhood's many professionals, a 
doctor or lawyer- whatever. He definitely seemed to belong. He fit in seamlessly 


He had known from the start that he would have to carry out this murder alone. Jill 


shouldn't be out here in McLean Village. 
This was the really bad one for him personally. This one was over the top, even for Jack 
and Jill, even for the game of games. 


The murder this morning would be extrenely dangerous. 
This target might know that someone was coming for him. 
Number four was going to be a hard one, done the hard way. 
He thought about all this as he steadily jogged toward his final destination in the pretty 


and peaceful Washington suburb. 


As he crossed onto Livingston Road, he attempted to clear his mind of everything except 
the terrible murder that lay ahead of him. 
He was Jack once again, the brutal celebrity stalker. He was going to prove it in just a 


few minutes. 


This one was going to be tough, the hardest so far. The man he was about to kill had 
been one of his best friends. 
In the game of life and death, that didn't matter. 
He had no best friends. He had no friends at all. 
I AM SAM, Sam I am, he was thinking as he ran. 
But he wasn't really Sam Harrison. 
He didn't have blond hair, or wear trendy jogging suits with logos on the breast pocket, 


either. 
Who in hell am I? What am I becoming? he asked himself as his feet struck the 
pavement hard. 



He knew that the house at 31 Livingston Road was guarded by a sophisticated security 
system. He would have expected nothing less. 

He ran at a quickening pace now. Eventually, he veered off the macadam road and 
disappeared into underbrush and pine trees. 

He kept running through the woods. 

He was in good shape and hadn't broken much of a sweat yet. 

The cold weather helped. He was alert, fresh, ready for the game to resume, ready to 
murder again. 

He figured that he could get up close, perhaps as near as ten yards from the house without 
being seen. Then a quick dash to the garage. 

For that short period, he would be out in the open. Completely exposed. There was no 
way around it and, God knows, he had tried to figure out an alternative attack plan. 

He was about to attack a house in McLean. How incredible that seemed. This was like a 
war. A war fought at home. A revolutionary war. 

There were two other large Colonial-style houses that he could see from the light woods. 
No lights on yet; no one seemed to be up anywhere on Livingston Road. So far, his luck 
was holding okay. His luck, or his skill, or maybe a combination of both. 

As far as he could tell, no one was awake at 31 Livingston. He couldn't be sure until he 
was inside the house itself, and then it would be too late to turn back. 

The FBI could be waiting in there or lurking right in these woods. Nothing would 
surprise him now. Anything could happen, at any time, to either him or Jill. 

He decided to walk out from the woods, looking calm, looking casual. As if he belonged. 
He didn't make much noise as he gently raised the garage door. He quickly ducked under 
the partially open door and he was inside. 

He went straight to the Nutone security box and punched in the code. So much for high 
security in the suburbs. There was no effective protection, really. Not from people like 
him. 

He entered the main part of the house. His heart pounded like a battering ram inside his 
chest. There was a sheen of sweat on his neck now. He could picture Aiden's face. He 
could see Aiden as if he were standing there beside him. 


Everything was peaceful and quiet and orderly inside the house. Fridge gently humming. 
Kids' artwork and a school lunch menu attached to the door with magnets. That made his 
heart sink. Aidenk kids. 


Aiden Junior was nine years old. Charise was six. The wife, Merrill, was thirty-four, 
fifteen years younger than her husband. 


It was her second marriage, his third. They'd seemed very much in love the last time he 
had seen them together. 


Jack moved quickly into the living room. He stopped breathing. 


Someone was in the living room! 


Jack whirled to the left. He yanked up his pistol and pointed it at the man. Jesus God, it 


was only a goddamn mirror! He was looking at his own image. 
He managed to catch his breath, then continued on his mission, his heart still thundering. 
He hurried through the living room. It was so familiar, lots of memories seeping into his 
consciousness. Painful thoughts. He pushed them aside. 


He began to climb up plush carpeted stairs, then stopped for a second. For the first time, 
he had doubts. 
There can't be any doubts! Doubt and uncertainty weren't allowed! 


Not in this. Not in Jack and Jill. 
He remembered the upstairs hallway, knew the house very well. He'd been here before -- 
as a "friendly." 


The master bedroom was the last door on the right. 


There would be weapons in the bedroom. A.357 in the drawer of the night table. An 
automatic taped under the bed. 
He knew. He knew. He knew everything. 
If Aiden had already heard him, everything would be over. 
The game would end right there. This would be it for Jack and Jill. 
Nutcruncher time. Weird thoughts. Too many of them. 



He had finally gone to see Pulp Fiction the night before. It hadn't relaxed him, though 
he'd laughed out loud several times. 

Sick story; he was even sicker; America was sickest of all. 
Don't think anymore, he warned himself. Just do this. Do it efficiently. Do it now! Do 
it fast! Get out! 


Jack kills American celebrities! Various and sundry bigshots. 
That what he does. Be Jack! 
But he wasn't really Jack! 
He wasn't really Sam Harrison! 
Don't think, he commanded himself again as he hurried down the upstairs hallway to the 


master bedroom. 
Be Jack. 
Kill. 
JACK -- whoever the hell he was -- was three or four steps from the master bedroom 


when its varnished wood door suddenly opened. 


A tall, balding man stepped out into the hall. Very hairy arms and legs. Bare, bony feet; 
toes splayed. Only half awake. In the middle of a jaw-cracking yawn. 
He had on blue plaid boxer shorts, nothing else. A good build, still athletic-looking; just 


a hint of a spare tire above the boxers' elastic band. Still formidable after all the years of 


D.C. power lunches. 
General Aiden Cornwall! 
"You! You son of a bitch!" he whispered as he suddenly saw Jack in the upstairs hallway 
"I knew it might be you." Yes, Alden Cornwall knew everything in an instant. He had 
solved the mystery; a lot of mysteries, actually He understood Jack and Jill. 

Where it was going. And why it was going this. Not in Jack and Jill. 
He remembered the upstairs hallway, knew the house very well. He'd been here before --

General Aiden Cornwall! 

"You! You son of a bitch!" he whispered as he suddenly saw Jack in the upstairs hallway 
"I knew it might be you." Yes, Alden Cornwall knew everything in an instant. He had 
solved the mystery; a lot of mysteries, actually He understood Jack and Jill. 

Where it was going. And why it was going there: why it had to be this way. Why there 
could be no turning back. 

Jack fired the silenced Beretta twice and the target collapsed. 
Jack quickly stepped forward and caught the lifeless body before it could thud loudly 
against the floor. 


He held the body in his arms, lowering it slowly to the carpet. 


His friend, whatever that meant now. He stayed down on his knees for a long moment. 
His heart was exploding. 
He hadn't realized how hard this one was going to be until now. Not until this instant. 
He looked down into the startled gray blue eyes of the former member of the Joint 


Chiefs, part of the White House's Jack and Jill emergency task force. 


One of the hounds had been taken out. Just like that. Jack and Jill had struck back boldly 
at the manhunters! They had shown their strength again. 
He took a note from his pocket. He left a calling card on Aiden Cornwall's chest. 
Jack and Jill came to The Hill To storm your picket fences. 
Once safe and sound They easily found The flaw in your Defenses. 
A noise in the hall! He looked up. Aiden's boy! "Oh, Jesus God, no," he whispered out 


loud. "Oh, God, no." He felt sick all over. He wanted to run from the house. 


The boy had recognized him. How could he not? Young Aiden even knew his children. 
He knew too much. Dear God, have mercy on me. Please have mercy. 
Jack fired the Beretta again. 
This was war. 
I WAS CALLED to an emergency criss team meeting at the White House at 8:00 A.M. 


on December 10. I had been causing some trouble over the past few days there. My 
internal investigation was making waves, ruffling feathers. The big cats on The Hill 
didn't like being under suspicion -- but all of them were, at least in my book. 


Jay Grayer grabbed me the moment I arrived inside the West Wing. Jay's eyes were flat 
and cold and hard. His grip was strong on my shoulder. "Alex, I need to talk to you for a 
minute," he said. "It's important." 

"What's going on now?" I asked the Secret Service agent. He didn't look well. There 
were dark puffs under both his eyes. 

Something else had happened. I could tell. 

"Aiden Cornwall was murdered early this morning. It happened at his house out in 
McLean. It was Jack and Jill. They called us again. Called it in to us like we're mission 
control." 

He shook his head in sadness and disbelief. "They killed Aiden's nine-year-old son, 
Alex." 

I found myself rocking back on my heels. The news from Jay Grayer didn't make sense 
to me; it didn't track with the Jack and Jill style to this point. Goddamn them! They kept 
changing the rules. They had to be doing it on purpose. 

"I want to go there right now," I told him. "I need to see the house. I need to be out there, 
not here." 

"I hear you, but wait a minute, Alex," he said. "Hold on. Let me tell you the rest of 
what's going on. It gets worse." 

"How could it get any worse?" I asked him. "Jesus, Jay." 

"Trust me, it does. Just listen for a minute." 

Agent Grayer continued to talk in a subdued whisper in the White House hallway as we 
walked together toward the Emergency Command Center, where the others were 
gathering. He pulled me aside a few paces from the meeting room. His voice was still an 
urgent whisper. 

"The President is always awakened at quarter to five by the agent in charge. Happens 
every morning. This morning, the President dressed and went down to the library, where 
he reads the early papers as well as an executive summary that's prepared for him before 
he rises." 

"What happened this morning?" I asked Jay. I was beginning to perspire. "What 
happened, Jay?" 

He was very thorough and procedural. "At five o'clock the phone in the library rang. It 
was Jill on the private line. She was calling to talk with the President. She got through to 
him, and that just isn't possible." 


My head involuntarily shook back and forth. I agreed with Jay Grayer: this couldn't be 
happening. The idea, the concept, of the President as a murder target was a hugely 
disturbing one. 

The fact that, so far, we were helpless to stop it was much, much worse. 

"I think I understand why the call couldn't happen, but tell me anyway," I said. I needed 
to hear it from him. 

"Every single call to the White House goes through a private switchboard. Then the call 
is monitored by a second operator in White House Communications, which is actually 
part of our Intelligence Division. Every call except this one. The call completely 
bypassed the control system. Nobody knows how the hell it happened. But it happened." 

"This phone call that couldn't have happened- was it recorded?" I asked Grayer. 

"Yes, of course it was. It's already being processed at FBI headquarters and also at Bell 
Atlantic out in White Oak. Jill used another filtering device to modify her voice, but 
there might be ways to get around that. We've got half the Baby Bell's high-tech lab on 
it." 

I shook my head again. I'd heard it, but I couldn't believe any of this. "What did Jill have 
to say?" 

"She began by identifying herself. She said, 'Hi, this is Jill speaking." I'm sure that got 
the President's attention better than his usual cup of joe in the morning. Then she said, 
'Mr. President, are you ready to die?"" 

I NEEDED TO SEE the house. I needed to be inside the place where General Cornwall 
and his son had been murdered. I needed to feel everything about the killers, their modus 
operandi. 

I got my wish. I reached McLean before nine that morning. 

The December day was very gray and overcast. The Cornwall house looked surreal, stark 
and cold, as I approached and then entered through the front door. It was cold on the 
inside, too. 

Either the Cornwall family was denying that winter was coming or they were saving 
money on heat. 

The double murders had been committed on the second floor. 

General Aiden Cornwall and his nine-year-old son still lay on their backs in the upstairs 
hallway It was a cold, calculated, very professional killing. The grisly murder scene 


looked like something from a casebook, maybe even one of my notebooks. It was 
forensic textbook stuff, almost too much so. 

FBI technicians and medical examiners were all over the house. There were probably 
twenty people inside. 

It began raining hard just after I arrived at the house. The cars and TV news trucks that 
came after me all had their headlights on. It was eerie as hell. 

Jeanne Sterling found me in the upstairs hallway. For the first time, the CIA inspector 
general seemed rattled. The severe, constant pressure was getting to all of us. Some 
people were after the President of the United States, and they were very good at this. 
They were extremely brutal as well. 

"What's your gut reaction, Alex?" asked Jeanne. 

"My reaction won't make any of our jobs easier," I said. "The only truly sustaining 
pattern I've seen is that Jack and Jill really don't have a pattern. Other than the notes, the 
poems. There certainly doesn't seem to be any sexual angle to these two murders. 

Also, from what I understand, Aiden Cornwall was a conservative, not a liberal like the 
other victims. That's a shift that might knock down a whole lot of theories about Jack 
and Jill." 

As I was talking to Jeanne Sterling, I had another insight into the notes Jack and Jill had 
left. The poetry might be telling us something important. The FBI linguistic agents 
hadn't found anything yet, but I didn't care. Whoever was writing the rhymes, probably 
Jill, wanted us to know something.... Was there a definite order to what they were doing? 
The desire to create instead of destroy? The poetry had to mean something. I was almost 
sure of it. 

"How about on your end, Jeanne? Anything?" 

Jeanne shook her head and bit her lower lip with her big teeth. 

"Not a thing." 

IT HAD BEEN a very long day and it was still going strong and hard. At ten o'clock that 
night, I arrived at the FBI offices on Pennsylvania Avenue. My mind was running way 
too fast as I rode the elevator up to twelve. The lights in the building were blazing like 
tiny campfires above D.C. I figured that Jack and Jill had a lot of people staying up late 
that night. I was only one of them. 

I'd come to the FBI offices to listen to the phone message Jill had sent to the President 
early that morning. All the important evidence was being made available to me. I was 
being let inside. I was even being allowed to make waves inside the White House. 


I knew all about horrible multiple killers; most of the rest of the team hadn't had that 
pleasure. 

No rules. 

I was brought by Security to an audio/electronics office on twelve. An NEC tape 
machine was waiting for me. A copy of Jill's voice tape was already in. The tape 
machine was on. Running hot. 

"This is a dupe, Dr. Cross, but it's close enough for your listening purposes," I was told. 
An FBI techie, long hair and all, went on to inform me they were certain that the voice on 
the tape had been altered or filtered electronically The FBI experts didn't believe the 
caller could possibly be identified from the tape. Once again, Jack and Jill had carefully 
covered their trail. 

"I talked to a contact at Bell Labs," I said. "He told me the same thing. Couple more 
experts confirm that and I'll believe it." 

The nonconformist-looking FBI technician finally left me alone with the taped phone 
call. I wanted it that way For a while I just sat in the office and stared out at the Justice 
Department across Pennsylvania Avenue. 

Jill was right there with me. 

She had something about herself to reveal, something she needed to tell us. Her deep, 
dark secret. 

The tape had been cued up. Her voice startled me in the silent, lonely office. 

Jill spoke. 

"Good morning, Mr. President. It's December ten. Exactly five A.M. Please don't hang 
up on me. This is Jill. Yes, the Jill. I wanted to speak to you, to make this situation very 
personal for you. Are we okay so far?" 

"It's way past 'personal."" President Byrnes spoke calmly to her. "Why are you 
murdering innocent people? Why do you want to kill me Jill?" 

"Oh, there's a very good reason, a fully satisfactory explanation for all our actions. 
Maybe we just like the power trip of frightening the so-called most powerful people in 
the world. Maybe we like sending you a message from all the little people you've 
frightened with your command decisions and almighty mandates from on high. At any 
rate, no one who's been killed was innocent, Mr. President. They all deserved to die, for 
one reason or another." 


Then Jill laughed. The sound of the electronically altered voice was almost childlike. 


I thought of Aiden Cornwall's young son. Why did a nine-year-old boy deserve to die? 
At that moment, I hated Jill -- whoever she was, whatever her motives. 
President Byrnes didn't back down. The President's voice was measured, calm. "Let me 


make one thing clear to you: you don't frighten me. Maybe you ought to be afraid, Jill. 


You and Jack. 
We're getting close to you now. There's nowhere on earth you can hide. There isn't one 
safe spot on the globe. Not anymore." 


"We'll certainly keep that in mind. Thanks so much for the warning. Very sporting of 
you. And you please keep this in mind -- you're a dead man, Mr. President. Your 
assassination is already a done deal." 

That was the end of the tape. Jill's final words to President Byrnes, spoken so coolly, so 
brazenly. 
Jill the morning deejay. Jill the poet. Who are you Jill? 


Your assassination is already a done deal. 
I wanted to interview President Byrnes again. I wanted to talk with him right now. I 
needed him in this office, listening to the sick, threatening tape with me. Maybe the 
President knew things that he wasn't telling any of us. Someone must. 


I played the frightening taped message several more times. 
I don't know how long I sat in the FBI office, staring out over the becalmed lights of 


Washington, D.C. They were somewhere out there. Jack and Jill were out there. 
Possibly planning an assassination. But maybe not. Maybe that wasn't it at all. 
You're a dead man, Mr. President. 
Your assassination is already a done deal. 
Why were they warning us? 
Why warn us about what they planned to do? 
IT WAS PAST TEN-THIRTY, but I still had one more important stop I wanted to make. 


I called Jay Grayer and told him I was on my way to the White House. I wanted to see 
President Byrnes again. Could he make it happen? 
"This can wait until the morning, Alex. It should wait." 



"It shouldn't wait, Jay. I've got a couple of theories that are burning a hole in my brain. I 
need the President's input. If President Byrnes says that it waits until the morning, then it 
waits. 

But talk to Don Hamerman and whoever else needs to be talked to about it. This is a 
murder investigation. We're trying to prevent murders. At any rate, I'm on my way over 
there." 

I arrived at the White House, and Don Hamerman was waiting for me. So was John 
Fahey, the chief counsel, and James Dowd, the attorney general and a personal friend of 
President Byrnes. 

They all looked put out and also very tense. This apparently wasn't how things were 
done in the Big House. 

"What the hell is this all about?" Hamerman confronted me angrily I had been waiting to 
see what his bite was like. I'd seen worse, actually 

"If you want, I'll wait until tomorrow. But my instincts tell me not to," I told him in a 
soft but firm voice. 

"Tell us what you want to say to him," James Dowd spoke up. 

"Then we'll decide." 

"I'm afraid that it's only for the President to hear. I need to talk with him, alone, just like 
we did the first time we met." 

Hamerman exploded. "Jesus Christ, you arrogant son of a bitch. We're the ones who let 
you in here in the first place." 

"Then you're the ones to blame, I guess. I told you that I was here to conduct a murder 
investigation and that you wouldn't like some of my methods. I told the President the 
same thing." 

Hamerman stormed away from us, but he returned in a couple of minutes. "He'll see you 
up on the third floor. This shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes of his time. It 
won't take more than a few minutes." 

"We'll see what the President has to say about that." 

THE TWO OF US met in a solahum that is attached to the living quarters on the third 
floor. The room had been a favorite of Reagan's. Outside the windows, the lights of 
Washington were shining brightly. I felt as if I were living a chapter out of All the 
President's Men. 


"Good evening, Alex. You needed to see me," the President said, and seemed calm and 
cheerful enough. Of course, there was no way for me to judge his true feelings. He was 
dressed casually in khakis and a blue sport shirt. 

"I apologize for coming in and causing a lot of upset and inconvenience," I said to him. 

The President raised his hand to stop me from apologizing further. "Alex, you're here 
because we wanted you to do exactly what you're doing. We didn't think anybody on the 
inside would have the balls. Now, what's on your mind? How can I help you?" 

I relaxed a little bit. How could the President help me? That was a question most of us 
had always wanted to hear. "I spent the day thinking about this morning's phone call, and 
also the murders out in McLean. Mr. President, I don't think we have a lot of time left. 
Jack and Jill are making that pretty clear. They're impatient, very violent; they're taking 
more and more risks. They also have a psychological need to rub it in our face every 
time that they can." 

"Are they just flattering their egos, Alex?" 

"Possibly, but maybe they want to diminish your power. Mr. President, I wanted to see 
you alone because what I have to say needs absolute confidentiality. As you know, we've 
been checking out everyone who works at the White House. The Secret Service has been 
cooperative. So has Don Hamerman." 

The President smiled. "I'll bet Don has." 

"In his own way, he has. A watchdog is a watchdog, though. 

Based on our findings so far, we've placed three members Of the current staff under 
surveillance by the Secret Service. We would rather watch than dismiss them. They've 
been added to the seventy-six others currently under surveillance around Washington." 

"The Secret Service always has a number of potential threats to the President under 
surveillance," Thomas Byrnes said. 

"Yes, sir. We're just taking precautions. I don't have particularly high hopes for the three 
staff members. They're all males. 

Somehow I thought we might turn up Jill. But we didn't." 

The President's look darkened. "I would have liked to meet Jill and have a private chat 
with her. I'd have liked that a lot." 

I nodded. Now came the really difficult part of our little talk. 


"I have to broach a tough subject, sir. We need to talk about some of the other people 
around you, the people closest to you." 

Thomas Byrnes sat forward in his chair. I could tell that he didn't like this at all. 

"Mr. President, we have reason to suspect that someone with access into the White 
House, or possibly with power and influence here, might be involved in all of this. Jack 
and Jill are certainly getting into high places with the greatest of ease The people close to 
you have to be checked, and checked very closely" 

Both of us were suddenly quiet. I could almost visualize Don Hamerman waiting 
outside, chewing on his silk tie. 

I broke the awkward silence. 

"I know that we're talking about things you would rather not," I said. 

The President sighed. "That's why you're here. That's why you're here." 

"Thank you," I told him. "Sir, you have no reason not to trust me on this. As you said 
yourself I'm an outsider. I have nothing to gain." 

Thomas Byrnes sighed a second time. I sensed that I had reached him, at least for the 
moment. "I trust many of these people with my life. Don Hamerman is one of them, my 
bulldog, as you correctly surmised. Whom don't I trust ? I'm not completely comfortable 
with Sullivan or Thompson at the Joint Chiefs. I'm not even sure about Bowen at the 
FBI. I've made serious enemies on Wall Street already. Their reach inside Washington is 
very deep and very powerful. I understand that organized crime is none too pleased with 
my programs, and they are much more organized now than they've ever been. I'm 
challenging an old, powerful, very fucked-up system -- and the fucked-up system doesn't 
like it. The Kennedys did that -- especially Robert Kennedy" 

I was having trouble catching my breath all of a sudden. "Who else, Mr. President? I 
need to know all your enemies." 

"Helene Glass in the Senate is an enemy... Some of the reactionary conservatives in the 
Senate and House are enemies.... I believe... that Vice President Mahoney is an enemy, 
or close to one. I made a compromise before the convention to put him on the ticket. 
Mahoney was supposed to deliver Florida and other parts of the South. He did deliver. I 
was supposed to deliver certain considerations to patrons of his. I haven't delivered. 

I'm screwing with the system, and that isn't done, Alex." 

I listened to Thomas Byrnes without moving a muscle. The effect of talking to the 
President like this was numbing and disturbing. I could see by the look on his face what 
it cost Thomas Byrnes to admit some of what he had to me. 


"We should put surveillance on these people," I said. 

The President shook his head. "No, I can't allow it. Not at this time. I can't do that, 
Alex." The President rose from his chair. 

"How did your kids like the keepsakes?" he asked me. 

I shook my head. I wouldn't be held off like that. "Think about the vice president, and 
about Senator Glass, too. This is a murder investigation. Please don't protect someone 
who might be involved. Please, Mr. President, help us... whoever it is." 

"Goodnight, Alex," the President said in a strong, clear voice. 

His eyes were unflinching. 

"Goodnight, Mr. President." 

"Keep at it," he said. Then he turned away from me and walked out of the solarium. 

Don Hamerman entered the room. "I'll see you out," he said stiffly. He was cold --
unfriendly Perhaps I also had an enemy in the White House. 

NO WAY, JOSE! Couldn't be. Could not be. This just could not be happening. 
Welcome to the X-Files meets The Twilight Zone meets the Information Superhighway 
At five one and two hundred ten pounds, Maryann Maggio was a powerhouse. She 
thought of herself as a "censor of the obscene and dangerous" on the Prodigy interactive 
network. Her job with Prodigy was to protect travelers on the Information Superhighway 
An emergency was developing before her eyes right now. There was an intruder on the 
network. 

This couldn't be happening. She couldn't take her eyes off her IBM desktop screen. 
"This is the interactive age, all right. Well, people, get ready for it," she muttered at the 
screen. "There's a train wreck a-comin'." 

Maryann Maggio had been a censor with IBM-owned Prodigy for nearly six years. By 
far, the most popular service on Prodigy was the billboards. The billboards were used by 
members to broadcast personal messages for other members to react to, learn from, plan 
their vacations, find out about a new restaurant, that sort of thing. 

Usually the messages were pretty harmless, covering topical subjects, questions and 
answers on anything from welfare reform to the ongoing murder trial of the month. 

But not the messages that she was staring at right now. This called for Infante the 
Censor, the protector of young minds, as she sometimes thought of herself. "Big Sister," 
according to her bearded, three-hundred-pound husband, Terry the Pirate. 


She had been monitoring messages from a particular subscriber in Washington, D.C., 
since around eleven that night. In the beginning, the quirky messages were borderline 
judgment calls for her to make. Should she censor or hold back? After all, Prodigy now 
had to compete with the Internet, which could get pretty damn wild and wacky She 
wondered if the sender knew this. Cranks sometimes knew the rules. They wanted to 
push the edge of the envelope. 

Sometimes they just seemed to need human contact, even contact with her. The censor of 
their thoughts and actions. Big Sister is watching. 

The first messages had asked other subscribers for their "sincere" point of view on a 
controversial subject. A child-murder case in Washington, D.C., was described. Then 
subscribers were asked whether the child murders or the Jack and Jill case deserved more 
attention from the police and from the press. Which case was more important, morally 
and ethically? 

Maryann Maggio had been forced to pull two of the early messages. 

Not because of their content per se, but because of the repeated use of four-letter words, 
especially the dreaded f word and the s word and one of the c words. 

When she pulled the messages, though, it seemed to cause an unbelievable emotional 
explosion from the subscriber in Washington. First came a long, nasty diatribe about the 
"obscene and unnecessary censorship plague on Prodigy." It urged subscribers to switch 
to CompuServe and other rival on-line services. Of course, CompuServe and America 
Online had their censors, too. 

The messages continued to fly out of Washington faster than the D.C.-New York shuttle. 
One called for Prodigy to "fire the ass of your absurdly incompetent censor." Maryann 
Magio censored it. 

Another message used the f word eleven times in two paragraphs. 

She censored that fucker, too. 

Then the message sender became more than just another foul-mouthed, annoying loose 
cannon on the service. At 1:17 the subscriber in Washington began to claim 
responsibility for the two brutal child murders. 

The subscriber claimed that he was the murderer, and he would prove it, live on Prodigy. 

"Big Sister" pulled the message immediately She also called her supervisor to her cubicle 
at the Prodigy center in White Plains, New York. Her huge body was shaking all over 
like jelly by the time her boss arrived, bringing black coffee for both of them. Black 


coffee? Maryann needed a couple of Little John's "fully loaded" pizzas to get her through 
this total disaster. 

Suddenly, a brand-new message flashed across the screen from the Washington 
subscriber, who seemed articulate and intelligent enough, but incredibly angry and really, 
really crazy. 

The latest message listed gory details about the murder of a black child, "details only the 

D.C. police would know," the subscriber wrote. 
"Jesus, Maryann, what a nasty, weird creep," the Prodigy supervisor said over Maryann 
Magio's shoulder. "Are all the messages like this one?" 

"Pretty much, Joanie. He's toned down his language some, but the violence is really 
graphic stuff. Vampire creepy Been that way since I clipped his wings." 

The latest message from Washington continued to scroll before their eyes. The 
description seemed to be of an actual murder of a small black child in Garfield Park. The 
killer claimed to have used a sawed-off baseball bat reinforced with electrical tape. He 
claimed to have struck the child twenty-three times, and to have counted every single 
blow. 

"Stop this awful, freakish crap now. Pull the damn plug on him!" the supervisor quickly 
made her decision. 

Then the supervisor made an even more important decision. 

She decided the Washington Police Department had to be alerted about the suspicious 
subscriber. Neither she nor Maryann Maggio knew whether the child murders were real, 
but they sure sounded that way. 

At one-thirty in the morning, the Prodigy supervisor reached a detective at the 1st District 
in D.C. The supervisor made a note of the detective's rank and also his name in her own 
log: Detective John Sampson. 

I HAD GOTTEN TO BED at a little past one. Nana came and woke me at quarter to 
five. I heard her slippers scuffing across the bare wood of the bedroom floor. Then she 
spoke in a low whisper just above my ear. Made me feel as if I were six years old again. 

"Alex? Alex? You awake?" 

"Mm, hmm. You bet. I am now." 

"Your friend's down in the kitchen. Eating bacon and tomatoes out of my skillet like 
there's no tomorrow, and he would know, wouldn't he? He still eats it faster than I can 
cook it." 


I held in a soft, painful moan. My eyes blinked twice and felt badly puffed and swollen 
each time they opened. My throat was scratchy and sore. 

"Sampson's here?" I finally managed to say. 

"Yes, and he says he might have a lead on the Truth School killer. Isn't that a good way to 
start your day?" 

She was taunting me. Same as always. It wasn't even five o'clock in the morning and 
Nana had her rusty shiv in me already. 

"I'm up," I whispered. "I don't look like it, but I'm up." 

Less than twenty minutes later, Sampson and I pulled up in front of a brick townhouse on 
Seward Square. He admitted that he needed me at the scene. Rakeem Powell and a 
white detective named Chester Mullins, who wore an ancient porkpie hat, were standing 
outside their own cars, waiting for us. They looked extremely tense and uncomfortable. 

The street was on the moderately upscale side of Seward Square Park, less than a mile 
and a half from the Sojourner Truth School. This was probably Mullins's home beat. 

"It's the white-on-white Colonial motherlode on the corner," Rakeem said, pointing to a 
big house about a block away "Man, I like working in these high-rent neighborhoods. 
You'all smell the roses?" 

"That's window-cleaning solution," I said. 

"There goes my career with FTD," Rakeem Powell laughed, and so did his partner 
Chester. 

"Might not be the Partridge Family living in that nice house up yonder," Sampson 
cautioned the two detectives. "Beautiful surroundings, peaceful street and all, maybe a 
homicidal maniac shitheel waiting for us inside, though. You copy?" 

Sampson turned to me. "What are you thinking about, Sugar? 

You having your usual nasty thoughts on this? Feeling the gris-gris?" 

Sampson had told me what he knew on the short ride over to Seward Square. A 
subscriber to the Prodigy interactive service, an Army man, Colonel Frank Moore, had 
been sending messages about the child killings over the service. He appeared to know 
details about the murders that only the police and the real killer knew. He sounded like 
our freak. 

"I don't like what I'm hearing from you so far, Mister John. 


The killings suggest he's in a rage state, and yet he's fairly careful. 

Now he's reaching out for help? He's virtually leading us to his doorstep? I don't know if 
I get that. And I don't like it too much, either. That's what I'm feeling so far, partner." 

"I was thinking the same thing." Sampson nodded and kept staring at the house in 
question. "At any rate, we're here. Might as well check out what the colonel wanted us 
to see." 

"Not mutilated bodies," Rakeem Powell said and frowned deeply "Not at five on a 
Monday morning. Not more little kids stashed somewhere in that big house." 

"Alex and I will take the back door in," Sampson said to Rakeem. "You and Popeye 
Doyle here can cover the front. Watch the garage. If this is the killer's house, you might 
expect a surprise or two. Everybody wide-awake? Wakee-wakee!" 

Rakeem and the white man in the hat nodded. "Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed," Rakeem 
said with fake enthusiasm. 

"We have you covered, Detectives." Chester Mullins finally said something. 

Sampson nodded calmly "Let's do it then. Not daylight yet, maybe he's still in his 
coffin." 

Five-twenty A.M. and my adrenaline was pumping wildly I had already met all the 
human monsters I cared to meet in my lifetime. I didn't need any more on-the-job 
experience in this particular area. 

"Am I here to watch your ass?" I asked as Man Mountain and I moved toward the big 
house perched on the corner. 

"You got it, Sugar. I need you on this. You got the magic touch with these psycho-
killers," Sampson said without looking back at me. 

"Thanks. I think," I muttered. There was a real loud noise roaring in my head, as if I'd 
just taken nitrous oxide at the dentist's. 

I really didn't want to meet another psychopath; I didn't want to meet Colonel Franklin 
Moore. 

We cut across a spongy lawn leading to a long, deep porch with an ivy trellis. 

I could see a man and woman standing in the kitchen. Two people were already up 
inside. 


"Must be Frank and Mrs. Frank," Sampson muttered. 

The man was eating something as he leaned over the kitchen counter. I could make out a 
box of strawberry Pop-Tarts pastry, a carton of skim milk, and the morning's Washington 
Post. 

"Very Partridge Family," I whispered to John. "I really don't like this at all. He's leading 
us all the way, right to the door." 

"Homicidal maniac," he said through brilliantly white, gritted teeth. "Don't let the Pop-mups 
fool you. Only psychos eat that shit." 

"Not easily fooled," I said to Sampson. 

"So I hear. Let's do it then, Sugar. Time to be unsung heroes again." 

We both crouched down below the level of the kitchen windows -- no easy task. We 
couldn't see the man and woman from there, and they couldn't see us. 

Sampson grasped the doorknob and slowly turned it. 

THE BACK DOOR into the Moore house was unlocked, and Sampson pushed it right in. 
The two of us exploded into the homey kitchen with its smells of freshly toasted Pop-
Tarts and coffee. We were in the Capitol Hill section of Washington. The house and 
kitchen looked it. So did the Moores. Neither Sampson nor I was fooled by the trappings 
of normaIcy, though. We'd seen it before, in the homes of other psychos. 

"Hands on top of your heads! Both of you. Put your arms up slow and easy," Sampson 
yelled at the man and woman we had surprised in the kitchen. 

We had our Glocks trained on Colonel Moore. He didn't look like too much of a threat: a 
short man, thin and balding, middle-aged paunch, eyeglasses. He wore a standard-issue 
Army uniform, but even that didn't help his image too much. 

"We're detectives with the Metro D.C. police," Sampson identified the two of us. The 
Moores looked in shock. I couldn't blame them. Sampson and I can be shocking under 
the wrong circumstances, and these were definitely the wrong circumstances. 

"There's been some kind of really bad, really crazy mistake," Colonel Moore finally said 
very slowly and carefully. 

"I'm Colonel Franklin Moore. This is my wife, Connie Moore. 

The address here is 418 Seward Square North." He slowly enunciated each word. "Please 
lower your weapons, Officers. You're in the wrong place." 


"We're at the correct address, sir," I told the colonel. And you're the crank caller we want 


to talk to. Either you ''re a crank or you're a killer. 
"And we're looking for Colonel Frank Moore," Sampson filled in. He hadn't lowered his 
revolver an inch, not a millimeter. 


Neither had I. 


Colonel Moore maintained his cool pretty well. That concerned me, set my inner alarms 
off in a loud jangle. 
"Well, can you please tell us what this is all about? And please do it quickly Neither of 


us has ever been arrested. I've never even had a traffic violation," he said to both 
Sampson and me, not sure who was in charge. 

"Do you subscribe to Prodigy, Colonel?" Sampson asked him. 
It sounded a little crazy when it came out, like everything else lately Colonel Moore 
looked at his wife, then he turned back to us. 


"We do subscribe, but we do it for our son, Sumner. Neither of us has much time in our 
schedules for computer games. I don't understand them much and don't want to." 

"How old is your son?" I asked Colonel Moore. 
"What difference does that make? Sumner is thirteen years old. He's in the ninth grade 
at the Theodore Roosevelt School. 


He's an honor student. He's a great kid. What is this all about, Officers? Will you please 
tell us why you're here?" 

"Where is Sumner now?" Sampson said in a very low and threatening voice. 
Because maybe young Sumner was listening somewhere near in the house. Maybe the 
Sojourner Truth School killer was listening to us right now. 


"He gets up half an hour to forty-five minutes later than we do. His bus comes at six-
thirty Please? What is this about?" 
"We need to talk to your son, Colonel Moore," I said to him. 


Keep it real simple for right now. 
"You have to do better --" Colonel Moore started to say "No, ;ve don't have to do better," 
Sampson interrupted him. 



"We need to see your son right now. We're here on a homicide investigation, Colonel. 
Two small children have already been killed. Your son may be involved with the 
murders. We need to see your son." 


"Oh, dear God, Frank," Mrs. Moore spoke up for the first time. Connie, I remembered 
her name. "This can't be happening. 


Sumner couldn't have done anything." 
Colonel Moore seemed even more confused than when we first burst in, but we had 
gotten his full attention. "I'll show you up to Sumner's room. Could you please holster 
your weapons, at least?" 


"I'm afraid we can't do that," I told him. The look in his eyes was inching closer to panic. 
I didn't even look at Mrs. Moore anymore. 


"Please take us to the boy's bedroom now," Sampson repeated. 
"We need to go up there quietly. This is for Sumner's own protection. You understand 
what I'm saying?" 


Colonel Moore nodded slowly His face was a sad, blank stare. 
"Frank?" Mrs. Moore pleaded. She was very pale. 
The three of us went upstairs. We proceeded in single file. 
I went first, then Colonel Moore, followed by Sampson. I still hadn't ruled out Franklin 


Moore as a suspect, as a potential madman, as the killer. 
"Which room is your son's?" Sampson asked in a whisper. 
His voice barely made a sound. Last of the Masai warriors. On a capital-murder case in 


Washington, D.C. 


"It's the second door on the left. promise you, Sumner hasn't done anything. He's 
thirteen years old. He's first in his class." 
"Is there a lock on the bedroom door?" I asked. 
"No... I don't think so... there might be a hook. I'm not sure. He's a good boy, 


Detective." 
Sampson and I positioned ourselves on either side on the closed bedroom door. We 
understood that a murderer might be waiting inside. Their good boy might be a child 
killer. Times two. 



Colonel Moore and his wife might have no idea about their son, and what he was truly all 


about. 
Thirteen years old. I was still slightly stunned by that. Could a thirteen-year-old have 
committed the two vicious child murders? 


That might explain the amateurness at the crime scenes. 
But the rage, the relentless violence? The hatred? 
He's a good boy, Detective. 
There was no lock, no hook, on the boy's door. Here we go. Here we go. Sampson and I 


burst into the bedroom, our guns drawn. 
The room was a regular teenager's hideout, only with more computer and audio 


equipment than most I'd seen. A gray cadet dress uniform hung on the open closet door. 
Someone had slashed it to shreds! 
Sumner Moore wasn't in his bedroom. He wasn't catching an extra half-hour of sleep that 


morning. 
The room was empty. 
There was a typewritten note on the crumpled bedsheets, where it couldn't be missed. 
The note simply said Nobody is gone. 
"What is this?" Colonel Moore muttered when he read it. 
"What is going on? What is going on? Can somebody please explain? What's happening 


here?" 


I thought that I got it, that I understood the boy's note. Sumner Moore was Nobody -- 
that was how he felt. And now, Nobody was gone. 
An article of clothing lying beside the note was the second part of the message to 


whoever came to his room first. He had left behind Shanelle Green's missing blouse. 


The tiny electric-blue blouse was covered with blood. 
A thirteen-year-old boy was the Truth School killer. He was in a state of total rage. And 
he was on the loose somewhere in Washington. 


Nobody was gone. 



THE SOJOURNER TRUTH SCHOOL killer traipsed along M Street reading the 
Washington Post from cover to cover, looking to see if he was famous yet. He had been 
panhandling all morning and had made about ten bucks. Life be good! 

He had the newspaper spread wide open, and he wasn't much looking where he was 
going, so he bumped into various assholes on his way. The Post was full of stories about 
goddamn Jack and Jill, but nothing about him. Not a paragraph, not a single word, about 
what he'd done. What a frigging joke newspapers were. 

They just lied their asses off, but everybody was supposed to believe them, right? 

Suddenly, he was feeling so bad, so confused, that he wanted to just lie down on the 
sidewalk and cry. He shouldn't have killed those little kids, and he probably wouldn't 
have if he'd stayed on his medication. But the Depakote made him feel dopey, and he 
hated it as if it were strychnine. 

So now his life was completely ruined. He was a goner. His whole life was over before 
it had really begun. 

He was on the mean streets, and thinking about living out here permanently. Nobody is 
here. And nobody can stop Nobody. 

He had come to visit the Sojourner Truth School again. Alex Cross's son went there and 
he was pissed as hell at Cross. The detective didn't think much of him, did he? He hadn't 
even come to the Teddy Roosevelt School with Sampson. Cross had dissed him again 
and again. 

It was approaching the noon recess at the Truth School and he decided to stroll by, maybe 
to stand up close to the fenced yard where they had found Shanelie Green. Where he had 
brought the body. Maybe it was time to tempt the fates. See if there was a God in 
heaven. Whatever. 

Rock-and-roll music was pounding nonstop in his head now. 

Nine Inch Nails, Green Day, Oasis. He heard "Black Hole Sun" and "Like Suicide" from 
Soundgarden. Then "Chump" and "Basket Case" from Green Day's Dookie. 

He caught himself, pulled himself back from the outer edge. 

Man, he had gone ya-ya for a couple of minutes there. He had completely zoned out. 
How long had he been out of it? he wondered. 

This was getting bad now. Or was it getting very good? Maybe he ought to take just a 
wee bit of the old Depakote. See if it brought him back anywhere near our solar system. 


Suddenly, he spotted the black bitch Amazon woman coming toward him. It was already 
too late to move out of the way of the cyclone. 

He recognized her right away She was the high-and-mighty principal from the Sojourner 
Truth School. She had a bead on him, had him in her sights. Man, she should have been 
wearing a o FVR T-shirt to play that kind of game. You put the bead on me -- then I'll 
put the bead on you, lady. You don't want my bead on you. Trust me on that, partner. 

She was yelling, raising her voice anyway "Where do you go to school? Why aren't you 
there now? You can't stand around here." She called loudly as she kept walking straight 
toward him. 

FUCK YOU, BLACK BITCH. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. 

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO? 

YOU... TALKIN'... TO... ME? 

"Do you hear me, mister? You deaf or something? This is a drug-free area, so move on. 
Now. There's absolutely no loitering near this school. That means you, in the fatigue 
jacket! Move on. 

Go on, get out of here." 

Just fuck you, all right? I'll move on when I'm good and ready. 

She came right up to him, and she was big. A lot bigger than he was, anyway 

"Move it or lose it. I won't take any crap from you. None at all. Now get out of here. 
You heard me." 

Well, hell. He moved on without giving her the satisfaction of word one. When he got 
up the block, he saw all the schoolkids being let outside into the yard with the high fence 
that didn't mean squat in terms of protection. Can't keep me out, he thought. 

He looked for Cross's little boy, searched the school yard with his eyes. Found him, too. 
No sweat. Tall for his age. Beautiful, right? Kute as hell. Damon was his name-o, 
name-o. 

The school principal was still out in the playground -- staring up the street at him, bad-
eyeing him. Mrs. Johnson was her name-o. 

Well, she was a dead woman now. She was already ancient history. Just like old 
Sojourner Truth -- the former slave former abolitionist. They all are the killer thought as 
he finally moved on. He had better things to do than loitering, wasting his precious time. 
He was a big star now. He was important. He was somebody Happy, happy. Joy, joy. 


"You believe that," he said to nobody in particular, just the generic voices crackling 
inside his head, "then you must be crazier than I am. I aren't happy There aren't no joy" 

As he turned the corner, he saw a police car coming up the street toward the school. It 
was time to get the hell out of there, but he would be back. 

THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON I gathered up my files and all my notes on Jack and 
Jill. I headed to Langley, Virginia, again. 

No music in the car that morning. Just the steady whhrrr of my tires on the roadway 
Jeanne Sterling had asked to see what I had come up with so far. She'd called halfa 
dozen times. She promised to reciprocate this time. You show me yours, I'll show you 
mine. 

Okay? Why not? It made a lot of sense. 

An Agency assistant sporting a military-style crew cut, a woman in her twenties, escorted 
me into a conference room on the seventh floor. The room was filled with bright light 
and was a far cry from my cube in the White House basement. I felt like a mouse out of 
its hole. Speaking of the White House, I hadn't heard from the Secret Service about any 
plan to investigate possible enemies of the President in high places. I would stir that pot 
again when I got back to D.C. 

"On a clear day you used to be able to see the Washington Monument," Jeanne Sterling 
said as she came striding in behind me. "Not anymore. The air quality in Fairfax County 
is abysmal. 

What's your reaction to the files on our killer elite, so far? Shock? 

Surprise? Boredom? What do you think, Alex?" 

I was starting to get used to Jeanne's rapid-fire style of speaking. 

I could definitely see her as a law school professor. "My first reaction is that we need 
weeks to analyze the possibility that one of these people might be a psychotic killer. Or 
that one of them might be Jack," I told her. 

"I agree with you on that," she nodded. "But just suppose we had to compress our search 
into about twenty-four fun-filled hours, which is about what we have to work with. Now 
then, are there any prime suspects in your mind? You have something, Alex. What is 
it?" 

I held up three fingers. I had three somethings so far. 


She smiled broadly Both of us did. You had to learn to laugh at the madness or it could 


bring you so far down, you'd never make it back up again. 
"Okay All right. That's what I like to hear. Let me guess," she said, and went ahead. 
"Jeffrey Daly, Howard Kamens, Kevin Hawkins." 


"Well, that's interesting," I said. "That might tell us something at least. Maybe we better 


start with the one name that's on both of our shortlists. Tell me about Kevin Hawkins." 
JEANNE STERLING spent about twenty minutes briefing me on Kevin Hawkins. 
"You'll be gratified to hear that we have Hawkins under surveillance already," she said as 
we rode a swift, smooth elevator down to the basement garage, where our cars were 
parked. 


"See, you don't need my help, after all," I said. I was buoyed by the prospect of any kind 


of progress on the case. I was actually feeling positive for the first time in several days. 
"Oh, but we do, Alex. We haven't brought him in for an interview, because we don't 
have anything concrete on him. Just nasty, nasty suspicions. That and a need to catch 
somebody. Let's not forget about that. Now you're suspicious, too." 


"That's all I have at this point," I reminded her. "Suspicions." 
"Sometimes that's enough, and you know it. Sometimes it has to be." 
We arrived at the small private garage underneath the CIA complex at Langley. The 


space was filled mostly with family vehicles like Taurus station wagons, but there were a 
few high-testosterone sports cars as well. Mustangs, Bimmers, Vipers. 

The cars matched up fairly well with the personnel I had seen upstairs. 
"i guess we should take both our cars,"Jeanne suggested, and it made sense to me. "I'll 
drive back here when we're through. 


You can go on into D.C. Hawkins is staying with his sister in Silver Spring. He's at the 
house now. It's about half an hour on the beltway, if that." 
"You're going to take him in now?" I asked her. It sounded like it to me. 


"I think we should, don't you? Just to have a little chat, you know." 
I went to my car. She walked to her station wagon. "This man we're going to see, he's a 
professional killer," I called to her across the garage floor. 


She called back, her voice echoing against concrete and steel. 



"From what I gather, he's one of our very best. Isn't that a fun thought?" 
"Does he have an alibi for any of the Jack and Jill murder dates?" 
"Not that we know of. We'll have to ask him more about it -- in detail." 
We got into our respective cars and started up the engines. 
I was beginning to notice that the CIA inspector general wasn't a bureaucrat; she certainly 


wasn't afraid to get her hands dirT Mine, either. We were going to meet another "ghost." 
Was he Jack? Could it be that easy? Stranger things had happened. 
It took the full thirty minutes to get over to Hawkins's sister's house in Silver Spring, 


Maryland. The houses there were somewhat overpriced, but it was still considered a 
middle-class area. 


Not my middle class. Somebody else's. 
Jeanne pulled her Volvo wagon up alongside a black Lincoln parked three-quarters of a 
block from the sister's house. She powered down the passenger-side window and talked 
to two agents inside the parked car. One of her surveillance teams, I guessed. 


Either that or she was asking directions to the assassin's hideout, which struck me as 
humorous. One of the few laughs I'd had recently. 
Suddenly, I saw a man come out of the sister's Cape Cod-style house. 


I recognized Kevin Hawkins from his file pictures. No doubt about it. 
He threw a quick glance down the street, and he must have seen us. He started to run. 
Then he hopped on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle parked in the driveway. 


I shouted, "Jeanne," out my open window and gunned my engine at the same time. 
I began to chase... Jack? 
THE FIRST THING Kevin Hawkins did on the motorcycle was to cut sharply sideways 


over the sliver of frost-covered lawn separating two split-level ranch houses. He raced 
past a few more houses, one of them with an aboveground pool covered by a baby-blue 
tarp for the winter. 

I aimed my old Porsche along the same inland route that Hawkins was taking. 
Fortunately, the past few days had been cold, and the ground was mostly solid. I 
wondered if anybody from the houses had spotted the motorcycle and car crazily 
zigzagging through their backyards. 


The motorcycle took a sharp right onto the development road past the last row of houses. 
I followed close behind. My car Was bouncing high. Then it scraped bottom loudly 
against the high curb. It thudded hard onto the road pavement, and my head struck the 
rooftop. 

As we approached an intersecting street, the Volvo station wagon and the Lincoln joined 
the race. A few neighborhood kids who were playing flag football in spite of the 
miserable weather stopped to gawk wide-eyed at the real-life police chase roaring up the 
suburban street. 

I had my Glock out and the window rolled down. I wasn't going to fire unless he did. 
Kevin Hawkins wasn't wanted for any specific crime yet. No warrants had been served. 
Why was he running? He sure was acting guilty about something. 

Hawkins leaned the Harley into a steep curve as he downshifted into fourth. I 
remembered another life and time spent on a fast motorcycle. I recalled its amazing 
maneuverability. 

The rawness of the speed. The feeling when your skin begins to tighten against your 
skull. I rememberedJezzie Flanagan, and her motorcycle. 

Hawkins's bike made a deep, guttural roar as it climbed the hilly road like a ground 
rocket. 

I tried to keep up, and was doing a pretty decent job. Amazingly, so was the Volvo 
wagon and the sedan. The chase scene was complete madness, though -- suburbia 
suddenly racing out of control. 

Was Jack up ahead? 

Was Hawkins Jack? 

I watched Kevin Hawkins stretch himself flat over the handlebars of the bike. He knew 
how to ride. What else did the trained killer know how to do? 

He was accelerating into fifth, approaching ninety or so on a narrow suburban road 
repeatedly marked for thirty-five. 

Then up ahead -- traffic! 

The bane of our existence was suddenly the most glorious and welcome sight in the 
world to me. 

A traffic jam! 


Several cars and vans were already backed up in the direction we were coming from. 

A bright orange mini-school bus was stopped in the opposite lane. It was discharging a 
thin line of children, as it did probably every day about this time. 
Hawkins hadn't slowed the cycle much, though. Suddenly, he was riding the double line 

in the road. He hadn't slowed the cycle at all. 
I realized what he was going to do. 
He was going to split the stopped traffic, and keep on going. 
I started to brake and cursed loudly. I knew what I had to do. 
I swerved off the road again, traveling cross-country over more lawns. A woman in a 


black pea jacket and jeans screamed at me from her porch and waved a snow shovel. 


I headed toward where the main road looped down ahead to meet the lane I had been 
stuck in traffic in only a few seconds ago. 
Jeanne Sterling followed in her station wagon. So did the Lincoln sedan. Madness and 

chaos helter-skelter in Silver Spring. 
Was this Jack up ahead? Were we about to nab the celebrity stalker and killer? 
I had high hopes. We were so close to him. Less than a hundred yards. 
I kept my eyes pinned on the bouncing, speeding motorcycle. 
Suddenly, it went down! 
The bike slid on one side, sending up a sheet of bright orange and white sparks against 


the roadway black. A few kids were still walking in a line between the bus and the 
stopped traffic. 
Then Hawkins went down! 
He had gone down to avoid hitting the children. 
He had swerved to avoid hitting the kids! 
Hawkins was down on the road. 
Could this be Jack up ahead? 
If not, who in the name of God was he? 



I was out of the car, holding my Glock, racing like a madman toward the bizarre accident 


scene. I was slip-sliding on the ice and snow, but I wouldn't let it slow me down. 
Jeanne Sterling and her two agents were out of their cars as well, but they weren't doing 
as well in the slush. I was losing my cover. 


Kevin Hawkins managed to pull himself up from the sprawling heap. He looked back. 


He saw us coming. Guns everywhere. 
He had a gun out, but he didn't fire. He was only a few feet away from the school bus 
and the children. 


He left the kids alone, though. Instead, he ran to a black Camaro convertible at the head 
of the line of stopped cars. 

What the hell was he up to now? 
I could see him yelling into the driver-side window of the stopped sports car. Then blam, 
he fired directly into the open window. 


Hawkins yanked open the car door, and a body fell out. 
Jesus Christ, he'd shot the driver dead! Just like that. 
I had seen it, but I couldn't believe it. 
The contract killer took off in the Camaro. He'd killed someone for his car. But he'd 


nearly killed himself to avoid hitting a row of innocent children. 
No rules... or rather, make up your own. 
I stopped running and stood helplessly in the middle of the street in Silver Spring. Had 


we just been that close to catching Jack ? 
Had it almost been over? 
NANA MAMA was still up when I got home about eleven-thirty that night. Sampson 


was with her. 


Adrenaline fired through my body the moment I saw them waiting for me. The two of 
them looked even worse than I felt after a long bear of a day. 
Something was wrong. Something was very wrong at our house. I could tell it for sure. 


Sampson and Nana didn't have casual visits after eleven o'clock at night. 



"What's going on? What happened?" I asked as I came in through the kitchen door. My 
stomach was dropping, plunging. 

Nana and Sampson sat at the small dining table. They were talking, conspiring over 
something. 

"What is it?" I asked again. "What the hell is going on?" 

"Someone's been calling on the telephone all night tonight, Alex. Then they just hang up 
when I answer the phone," my grandmother told me as I sat at the kitchen table beside 
her and Sampson. 

"Why didn't you call me right away?" I asked, firmly but gently "You have my beeper 
number. That's what it's for, Nana." 

"I called John," Nana answered the question. "I knew you were busy protecting the 
President and his family." 

I ignored her usual rancor. This wasn't the time for that, or for a tiff. "Did the caller ever 
say anything?" I asked. "Did you actually speak to anyone?" 

"No. There were twelve calls between eight-thirty and ten or so. None since then. I 
could hear someone breathing on the line, Alex. I almost blew my whistle on them." 
Nana keeps a silver referee's whistle near the phone. It's her own solution to obscene 
calls. This time I almost wished she had blown the damn whistle. 

"I'm going to bed now," she said and sighed softly, almost inaudibly. 

For once, she actually looked her age. "Now that you're both here." 

She strained as she pushed herself up out of the creaking kitchen chair. She went over to 
Sampson first. She bent just a little and kissed him on the cheek. 

"'Night, Nana," he whispered. "There's nothing to worry about. We'll take care of 
everything, bad as it seems right now." 

"John, John," she gently scolded him. "There's a great deal of worry about, and we both 
know it. Don't we, now?" 

She came and kissed me. "Goodnight, Alex. I'm glad you're home now. This murderer 
stalking our neighborhood worries me so. It's very bad. Very bad. Please trust my 
feelings on this one." 

I held her frail body for a few seconds, and I could feel the anger building inside. I held 
her tightly and thought about how terrible this was, what she was intimating, this evil 


incarnate following me home. No one in his right mind goes after a cop's family I didn't 
believe the killer was in his right mind, though. 

"Goodnight, Nana. Thank you for being here for us," I whispered against her cheek, 
smelled her lilac talc. "I hear what you're saying. I agree with you." 

When she had left the room, Sampson shook his head. Then he finally smiled. "Tough 
as ever, man. She's really something else. I love her, though. I love your grandma." 

"I do, too. Most of the time." 

I was staring up at the ceiling light, trying to focus on something that I could comprehend 
-- like electricity, lamps, moldings. 

No one can really understand a homicidal madman. They are like visitors from other 
planets -- literally I was almost speechless, for once in my life. I felt violated, incredibly 
angry, and also afraid for my family Maybe these phone calls were nothing, but I didn't 
know that for sure. 

I got a couple of beers from the fridge, popped them open for the two of us. I needed to 
talk to Sampson, anyway There hadn't been a free moment all day long. 

"She's afraid for the kids' sake. That gets the fur up on her neck. Claws out," Sampson 
said, then took a long sip of beer. 

"Sharp claws, man." I finally managed a half-smile in spite of the incredibly bad 
circumstances and my weariness. 

We both listened to the silence of the old house on Fifth Street for a long moment. It was 
finally punctuated by the familiar dull clanging of the heating pipes. We took pulls on 
our bottles of ale. 

No invasive phone calls came now. Maybe Nana's whistle wasn't such a bad idea. 

"How are you and the all-stars doing with the search for the Moore kid?" I asked 
Sampson. "Anything today? Anything new from the rest of our group? I know our 
surveillance is breaking down. Not enough manpower." 

Sampson shrugged his broad shoulders, moved in his seat. 

His eyes turned hard and dark. "We found traces of makeup in his room. Maybe he used 
makeup to play the part of an old man. 

We will find him, Alex. You think he's the one who called here tonight?" 


I spread my hands, then I nodded my head. "That would make sense. He definitely 
wants special attention, wants to be seen as important, John. Maybe he feels Jack and Jill 
is taking attention away from him, stealing the spotlight from his show. Maybe he knows 
I'm working Jack and Jill, and he's angry with me." 

"We'll just have to ask the young cadet," Sampson said. He smiled a truly malevolent 

smile, one of his best, or worst, ever. 
"Sure wish I was popular like you, Sugar. No freaks call me late at night. Write me 
mash notes at my house. Nothing like that." 


"They wouldn't dare," I said. "Nobody's that crazy, not even the Truth School killer." 


We both laughed, a little too loudly Laughter is usually the best and only defense in a 
really tough murder investigation. 
Maybe Jack and Jill had called me at home. Or Kevin Hawkins had called here. Or 


maybe even Gary Soneji, who was still out there somewhere, waiting to settle his old 
score with me. 

"Technician will be at the house first thing in the morning. 
Put a crackerjack hookup on your phone. We'll put a detective in here, too. Until we find 
the boy wonder anyway. I talked to Rakeem Powell. He's glad to do it." 


I nodded. "That's good. Thanks for coming by and being here for Nana." 


Things had taken a turn for the worse. They were threatening me in my own house now, 
threatening my family Someone was. 
The freaks were right at my doorstep. 
I couldn't get to sleep after Sampson left that night. 
I didn't feel like playing the piano. No music in me for the moment. 
I didn't dare call Christine Johnson. I went up and looked in on the kids. Rosie the cat 


followed me, yawning and stretching. 


I watched them, much as Jannie had watched me sleep the other morning. I was afraid for 
them. 
I finally dozed off about three in the morning. There were no more phone calls, thank 


God. 
I slept on the porch with the Glock in my lap. Home, sweet home. 



I HEARD THE KIDS squawking and squealing first thing the next morning. They were 
laughing loudly, and it both raised my spirits and mildly depressed me. 

I immediately remembered the situation we were in: the monsters were at our doorstep. 
They knew where we lived. There were no rules now. Nobody, not even my own family, 
was safe. 

I thought about the Moore boy for a moment or two as I lay on the old sofa on the porch. 
Strangely, nothing in his past history fit in with the two murders. It just didn't track. I 
considered the monstrous idea of a thirteen-year-old boy committing purely existential 
murders. I had a lot of material stored in my head on the subject. I vaguely recalled 
Andr Gide's Lafcadiok Adventures from grad school. The twisted main character had 
pushed a stranger from a train just to prove that he was alive. 

I glanced at the portable alarm clock beside my head. It was already ten past seven. I 
could smell Nana's strong coffee wafting through the house. I refused to let myself get 
down about the lack of progress. There was a saying I kept around for just such 
occasions. Failure isn't falling down... it's staying down. 

I got up. I went to my room, showered, put on some fresh clothes, rumbled back 
downstairs. I wasn't staying down. 

I found my two favorite Martians spiraling around the kitchen, playing some kind of tag 
game at seven in the morning. 

I opened my mouth and did my imitation of the silent scream from Edvard Munch's 
painting The Shriek. 

Jannie laughed out loud. Damon mimed a silent scream of his own. They were glad to 
see me. We were still best pals, best of friends. 

Somebody had called our house last night. 

Sumner Moore? 

Kevin Hawkins ? 

"Morning, Nana," I said as I poured a cup of steaming coffee from her pot. The best to 
you each morning and all that. I sipped the coffee and it tasted even more wonderful than 
it smelled. The woman can cook. She can also talk, think, illuminate, irritate. 

"Morning, Alex," she said, as if nothing bad had happened the night before. Tough as 
nails. She didn't want to upset the kids, to alarm them in any way. Neither didI. 


"Somebody will be by to look at our phone." I told her what Sampson and I had discussed 
the night before. "Somebody will be around for a few days, too. A detective. Probably 
it will be Rakeem Powell. You know Rakeem." 

Nana didn't like that news one bit. "Of course I know Rakeem. 

I taught Rakeem in school for heaven's sake. Rakeem has no business here, though. This 
is our home, Alex. This is so terrible. I just don't think I can stand it... that it's 
happening here." 

"What's wrong with our telephone?" Jannie wanted to know. 

"It works," I told my little girl. 

THE TWO MURDER CASES were beginning to feel like a single, relentless nightmare. 
I couldn't seem to catch my breath anymore. My stomach was in knots and apparently 
would stay that way for the duration of the investigation. The situation was Kafkaesque, 
and it was wearing down the entire Metro police force. No one could remember anything 
like it. 

I had decided to keep Damon home with Nana and Detective Rakeem Powell for a few 
days. Just to be on the safe side. Hopefully, we'd find thirteen-year-old Sumner Moore 
soon, and half the horror story would be ended. 

I continued to suspect either that Sumner Moore wanted to be caught or that he would be 
soon. The carelessness in both murders indicated it. I hoped that he wouldn't kill another 
child before we found him. 

I considered moving Nana and the kids to one of my aunts', but held back. Rakeem 
Powell would stay with them at the house. 

That seemed enough chaos and disruption to force into their lives. For the moment, 
anyway. 

Besides, I was almost certain Nana wouldn't have moved to one of her sisters' without a 
huge battle and casualties. Fifth Street was her home. She would rather fight than 
switch. Occasionally, she had. 

I drove to the White House very early in the morning. I sat in a basement office with a 
mug of coffee and a two-foot-thick stack of classified papers to read and ponder. These 
were literally hundreds of CIA reports and internal memos on Kevin Hawkins and the 
other CIA "ghosts." 

I met with Don Hamerman; the attorney general, James Dowd; and Jay Erayer at a little 
past nine. We used an ornate conference room near the Oval Office in the West Wing. I 
recalled that the White House had originally been built to intimidate visitors, especially 


foreign dignitaries. It still had that effect, especially under the current circumstances. 
The "American mansion" was huge, and every room seemed formal and imposing. 

Hamerman was surprisingly subdued at the meeting. "You made quite an impression on 
the President," he said. "You made your point with him, too." 

"What happens now?" I asked. "What actions do we take? 

Obviously, I'd like to help." 

"We've initiated some extremely sensitive investigations," Hamerman said. "The FBI 
will be handling them." Hamerman looked around the room. It seemed to me that he was 
reaffirming his power, his clout. 

"Is that it, what you wanted to tell me?" I asked him after a few seconds of silence. 

"That's it for now. You got it started. That's something. It's a really big deal." 

"It is a big deal," I said. "It's a fucking murder investigation in the White House!" I got 
up and went back to my office. I had work to do. I kept reminding myself that I was part 
of the "team." 

Hamerman peeked his head into the office about eleventhirty. His eyes were wider and 
wilder than usual. I thought that maybe he'd changed his mind about the latest 
investigation -- or had his mind changed for him. 

He didn't look himself. 

"The President wants to see us immediately." 

PRESIDENT BYRNES personally greeted each of us on the crisis team as we entered the 
Oval Office, which was indeed oval. 

"Thank you for coming. Hello, Jay, Ann, Jeanne, Alex. I know how busy you are, and 
the tremendous pressure you're all working under," he said as we walked in and began to 
take seats. 

The crisis team had been assembled, but President Byrnes clearly dominated the room 
and the unscheduled meeting. He was dressed in a dark blue chief executive's business 
suit. His sandy-brown hair was freshly barbered, and I couldn't help wondering if it had 
just been cut that morning, and if it had, where did he get the time? 

What had happened now? Had Jack and Jill contacted the White House again? 


I glanced across the room at Jeanne Sterling. She shrugged her shoulders and widened 
her eyes. She didn't know what was up, either. No one seemed to know what the 
President had on his mind, not even Hamerman. 

When we were seated, President Byrnes spoke. He stood directly in front of a pair of 
flags, army and air force. He seemed in control of his emotions, which was quite a feat. 

"Harry Truman used to say," he began, "'if you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog." 
I think I've experienced the precise feelings that inspired his wit. I'm almost sure that I 
have." 

The President was an unusually engaging speaker. I already knew as much from his 
address at his convention and other televised talks -- his version of FDR's fireside chats. 
He was clearly able to bring his oratory talents to a much smaller room and audience, 
even a tough, cynical crowd like the one before him. 

"What a royal pain in the butt this job can be. Whoever coined the phrase 'If drafted, I 
will not run; if elected, I will not serve' had the right idea. Believe me on that one." 

The President smiled. He had an ability to make anything he said sound personal. I 
wondered if he planned it. How much of this was a first-rate acting job? 

The President's intense blue eyes circled the room, stopping for a moment on each face. 
He seemed to be judging us, but more important, communicating with us individually. 
"I've been thinking a great deal about this current, unfortunate situation. 

Sally and I have talked about it upstairs, late into the night, several nights in a row. I've 
been thinking about Jack and Jill too much, in fact. For the past few days, this miserable 
three-ring circus has been the focus, and a major distraction to the executive branch of 
our government. It's already disrupted cabinet meetings and played havoc with 
everyone's schedule. This situation simply can't be allowed to continue. It's bad for the 
country, for our people, for everybody's mental health, including my own and Sally's. It 
makes us look weak and unstable to the rest of the world. A threat by a couple of kooks 
can't be permitted to disrupt the government of the United States. We can't allow that to 
happen. 

"As a consequence, I've made a tough decision, which ultimately has to be mine to make. 
I'm sharing it with you this morning, because the decision will affect all of you as well as 
Sally and me." 

President Byrnes let his eyes quickly roam around the room again. I didn't know where 
this was going yet, but the process was fascinating to me. The President led us a step, 
then he checked to make sure we were still with him. He was clearly issuing an order, 
but he made it seem as if he were still seeking some consensus in the room. 


"We simply have to return to business-as-usual at the White House. We have to do that. 
The United States can't be held hostage to real or imagined dangers or threats. That's the 
decision I'm making, and it goes into effect at the end of today We have to move on, to 
move ahead with our programs." 

As the President told us his decision, there was uneasy movement in the room. Ann 
Roper groaned out loud. Don Ham-erman dropped his head down low, close to his 
knees. I kept my eyes pinned on the President. 

"I fully understand that this makes your jobs more difficult, to say the very least. How in 
hell can you protect me if I won't cooperate, won't follow your recommendations? Well, 
I can't cooperate anymore. Not if it means sending a message to the world that a couple 
of psychopaths can completely alter our government. 

Which is exactly what is happening. It's happened, folks. 

"Starting tomorrow, I'm back on my regular schedule. There will be no further debate on 
that subject. Sorry, Don." He looked at his chief of staff as he officially rejected his 
advice. 

"I've also decided to make my scheduled visit to New York City on Tuesday Sorry again, 
Don, Jay I wish the best to all of us on our appointed tasks. You do your jobs, please. I'll 
try to do mine. We will have absolutely no regrets, no matter what happens from this 
point on. Is that understood?" 

"Understood, sir." Everyone in the room nodded yes. Every eye was intensely focused 
on the President, mine included. 

President Byrnes had been both impassioned and impressive. 

Absolutely no regrets, I repeated the phrase inside my head. 

I was sure I'd remember it for the rest of my life, no matter what happened, no matter 
what Jack and Jill had planned from here on. 

Thomas Byrnes had just put his life on the line, really on the line. 

The President had just put his life in our hands. 

"By the way, Don," President Byrnes said to Hamerman as the meeting was starting to 
break up. "Have somebody run out and get me a goddamn dog. I think I need a friend." 

We all laughed, even if we didn't quite feel up to it. 


THAT NIGHT it snowed about an inch in Washington. The temperature dropped way 
down into the teens. The Truth School killer woke up feeling scared. Feeling very alone. 
Feeling trapped. 

Feeling quite sad, actually. 
No happy, happy. No joy, joy. 
He was in a cold, greasy sweat that grossed him out completely In a dream that he 


remembered now, he had been murdering people, then burying them under a fieldstone 
fireplace at his grandparents' country home in Leesburg. He'd been having that same 
dream for years, ever since he could remember, ever since he was a kid. 

But was it a dream, or had I committed the grisly murders? 

he wondered as he opened his eyes. He tried to focus on the surroundings. Where the 
hell am I? 
Then he remembered where he was, where he had come to sleep for the night. What a 

mindblower! What a cool idea he'd had. 
The song, his song, blared inside his head: 
I'm a loser, baby So why don't you kill me? 
This hiding place was cool as shit. Or maybe he was just being too stupid and careless. 


Cool as shit? Or dumb and dumber? 
You be the judge. 
He was in his own house, up on the third floor. 
He wrapped his mind around the idea that he was "safe and sound" for now. Man, he 


loved the power of that thought. 
He was in total control. He was mission control. He could be as big and important as 


Jack and Jill. Hell, he could be bigger and better than those trippy assholes. He knew 
that he could. He could stomp Jack and Jill's asses. 
He felt around on the floor for his trusty backpack. Where the hell is his stuff?... Okay. 


There it is. Everything is cool. He fumbled inside -- located his flashlight. He flicked 
the ON switch. 
"Let there be light," he whispered. "Wah-lah!" 



Awhh, too bad sports fans -- he was definitely in the attic of his home. This wasn't a 
dream. He was the Truth School killer, after all. He shined the bright light down on his 
wristwatch. It was a twelfth-birthday present. It was the kind of sophisticated watch that 
pilots wore. Wow, he was so damn impressed! Maybe he could study to be a jet pilot 
after this was all behind him. Learn to fly an F-16. 

It was 4:00 A.a. on the jet pilot's watch! Must be 4:00 ,.M., then. 

"The hour of the werewolf," he whispered softly It was time to come down out of the 
attic. It was time to continue to make his mark in the world. Something cool and 
amazing had to happen now. 

Perfect murders. 

Had to, had to, had to. 

HE LET the bulky foldaway stairs drop down very slowly to the second floor of the 
house. His house. If his foster parents happened to get up for a pee right now- BIG 
PROBLEMS FOR HIM. 

BIG SURPRISE FOR THEM, THOUGH. 

MAJOR SHITSTORM FOR EVERYBODY CON CERNED. 

He was having a little trouble with his breathing. None of this was easy now. He needed 
to set the heavy, unwieldy stairs down quietly on the second floor, but there was a little 
thud right at the end. 

"Damn you. Loser," he whispered. 

He still couldn't exactly catch his breath. His body was covered with a thick coat of 
sweat, the kind horses break on a morning workout. He had seen that phenomenon on his 
grandparents' farm. Never forgot it: sweat that almost turned into this frothy cream, right 
before your eyes. 

"Pusillanimous," he whispered, mocking his own cowardice. 

"Chickenshit bastard. Punk of the month. Loser, man." His theme song again. 

He tried to let some of the icy panic and nervousness pass. 

He took long, slow, deep breaths as he paused at the top of the folding stairs. This was so 
freaky It was helter fucking skelter, in real life, in real time. 

He finally began to climb down the wobbly wooden stairway, on wobbly wooden legs 
that felt like stilts. He was being as careful and quiet as he could be. 


He felt a little better as he got to the bottom. Terra firma. 


He walked on his tiptoes down the upstairs hallway to the door of the master bedroom. 
He opened the door and was immediately struck with a blast of really cold air. 
His foster father kept the window open, even in December, even when it fucking snowed. 


He would. The arctic cold probably kept his silver-blond crew cut short. Saved him on 
haircuts. 

What a superjerk-off the guy was. 
"Do you screw her in the cold dark?" he whispered under his breath. That sounded about 
right, too. 


He walked up real close to their king-size bed. Real close. He stood at their altar of love, 
their sacred throne. 

How many times had he imagined a moment like this? This very moment. 
How many other kids had imagined this same scene a thousand thousand times? But then 
done nothing about it. Losers! 


The world was full of them. 


He was on the verge of one of his worst rages, a real bad one. The hair on the back of his 
neck was standing at attention. 
TEN-SHUN. It felt like it, anyway. 
He could see red everywhere in the bedroom. kike this misting red. It was almost as if 


he were viewing the room through a nightscope. 
He... was... just.. about... to... go.. off... wasn't.. he? 
He could feel himself... exploding... into.. a... billion... 
pieces. 
Suddenly, he screamed at the top of his voice. "Wake up and smell the fucking Folgerk 


coffee!" 
He was sobbing now, too. For what reason, he didn't know. He couldn't remember 
crying like this since he was a real little kid, real little. 



His chest hurt as if he'd been punched hard. Or hit with an eighteen-inch ballbat. He 
realized that he was starting to wimp out. Mister Softee was coming back. He felt like 
Holden Caulfield. Repentant. Always triple-thinking every goddamn move both before 
and after he made it. 

"POW," he screamed at the top of his voice. 
"POW," he screamed the word again. 
"?OW. 
"?OW. 
"POW. 
"POW. 
"POW. 
"POW "POW. 
"POW. 
"POW. 
"POW." 
And with every bloodcurdling yell, he pulled the trigger of the Smith & Wesson. He put 


another 9mm bullet into the two sleeping figures. Twelve shots, if he was counting 
correctly, and he was counting everything very correctly Twelve shots, just like Jose and 
Kitty Menendez got. 


The Roosevelt military education finally came in handy, he couldn't help thinking. His 


teachers had been right, after all. 
Colonel Wilson at the school would have been proud of the marksmanship- but most of 
all, the firm resolve, the very simple and clear plan, the extraordinary courage he had 
shown tonight. 


His foster parents were annihilated, completely vanquished, almost disintegrated by all 
the firepower he'd brought to the task. 
He felt nothing -- except maybe pride in what he had done, in his fine workmanship. 
Nobody was here. Nobody did this, man. 



He wrote it in their blood. 

Then he ran outside to play in the snow. He got blood all over the yard, all over 
everything. He could, you know. He could do anything he wanted to now. There was no 
one to stop Nobody ANOTHER MURDERED CHILD has been discovered. 

A male. Less than an hour ago. 

John Sampson got the news about seven o'clock in the evening. 

He couldn't believe it. Could not, would not, accept what he had just been told. Friday 
the thirteenth. Was the date deliberate? 

Another child murdered in Garfield Park. At least, the body was left there. He wanted 
Sumner Moore bad, and he wanted him now. 

Sampson parked on Sixth Street and began the short walk into the desolate and dreary 
park. This is getting worse, he thought as he walked toward the red and yellow 
emergency lights flashing brightly up ahead. 

"Detective Sampson. Let me through," he said as he pushed his way inside a circle of 
police uniforms. 

One of the uniforms was helding a gray-and-white yapping mutt on a leash. It was a 
weird touch at a weird scene. Sampson addressed the patrolman. "What's with the dog? 
Whose dog?" 

"Dog uncovered the victim's body Owner let it loose for a run after she got home from 
work. Somebody covered up the dead kid with tree branches. Not much else. Like he 
wanted somebody to find it." 

Sampson nodded at what he'd heard so far. Then he moved on, stepped closer to the 
body The victim was clearly older than either Vernon Wheatley or Shanelle Green. 
Sumner Moore had graduated from murdering very small children. The creepy little 
ghoul was on a full rampage now. 

A police photographer was taking pictures of the body, the camera's harsh flashes 
dramatic against the blanket of snow covering the park. 

The boy's mouth and nose were wrapped with silver duct tape. 

Sampson took a deep breath before he stooped down low next to the medical examiner, a 
woman he knew named Esther Lee. 

"How long you think he's been dead?" Sampson asked the M.E. 


"Hard to say Maybe thirty-six hours. Decomposition is slowed a lot in this cold weather. 
I'll know more after the autopsy The boy took a brutal beating. Lead pipe, wrench, 
something nasty and heavy like that. He tried to fight the killer off. You can see 
defensive bruises on both hands, on his arms. I feel so bad for this boy" 

"I know, Esther. Me, too." 
What John Sampson could see of the boy's neck was discolored and badly bloated. Tiny 


black bugs crawled along the hairline. A thin line of maggots spilled from a split in the 
scalp above the right ear. 
Sampson sucked it up, grimaced, and forced himself to move around to the other side of 


the boy's body Nobody knew it, not even Alex, but this was the part of homicide that he 
just couldn't handle. DOAs. Bodies in decomposition. 
"You won't like it," Esther Lee told him before he looked. "I'm warning you." 


"I know I won't," he muttered. He blew warmth on his hands, but it didn't help much. 
He could see the boy's face now. He could see it- but he couldn't believe it. And he 
certainly didn't like it. Esther kee was right about that. 


"Jesus Christ," he said out loud. "Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Make this terrible thing stop." 


Sampson stood up straight. He was six nine again, only it wasn't tall enough, wasn't big 
enough. He couldn't believe what he had just seen -- the boy face. 
This killing was too much even for him, and he had seen so much in D.C. during the past 


few years. 
The murdered boy was Sumner Moore. 
NO RULES. 
PART 5 
NO REGRETS, NOTHING EVER BEGINS at the time we believe it does. Still, this is 


what I think of as the beginning. 


Jannie and I sat in the kitchen and we talked the talk, our own special talk. The words 
didn't matter much, just the sentiments. 
"You know, this is an anniversary for us," I said to her. "Specialanniversary." 
I touched her cheek. So soft. Soft as a butterflys belly. 



"Oh, really ?" Jannie said and gave me her most skeptical Nana Mama look. "And what 
anniversary might that be?" 

"Well, I'll tell you. This just happens to be the five-hundredth time that I've read you The 
Stinky Cheese Man." 

"Okay, fine," she said and smiled in spite of herself, "so read the story already! I love the 
way you read it." I read the story again. 

After we were done with our Stinky Cheese, I spent some time with Damon, and then 
with Nana. Then I went upstairs to pack. 

When I came back down, I talked out on the porch with Rakeem Powell. Rakeem was 
waiting to be relieved. Sampson was coming over for the night. Man Mountain was late 
as usual, and we hadn't heard from him yet, which was a little unusual, but I knew he 
would be there. 

"You okay?" I asked Rakeem. 

"I'm fine, Alex. Sampson will get here eventually. You take care of yourself." 

I went out to my car. I stepped inside and put in a tape that felt right for the moment at 
hand -- for my mood, anyway. It was the finale to Saint-Sans's second piano concerto. I 
had always dreamed of being able to play the piece on the porch piano. 

Dream on, dream on. 

I listened to the blazing music as I drove out to Andrews airfield, where Air Force One 
was being prepared. 

President Byrnes was going to New York City, and I was going with him. 

No regrets. 

THERE HAVE BEEN many conflicting accounts, but this is what happened and how it 
happened. I know, because I was there. 

On Monday evening, nine days before Christmas, we landed in a grayish blue fog and 
light rain at La Guardia Airport on Long Island. No specific information about President 
Byrnes's travel plans had been announced to the press, but the President was keeping his 
commitment to speak in New York the following morning. Thomas Byrnes was known 
for keeping his commitments, keeping his word. 

It had been decided to go from La Guardia into Manhattan by car, rather than by 
helicopter. The President wasn't hiding anymore. 


Had Jack and Jill counted on just that kind of courage, or arrogance, from him? I 
wondered. Would Jack and Jill follow the President to New York? I was almost sure 
that they would. It fit everything we knew about them so far. 

"Ride with us, Alex," Don Hamerman said as we hurried across the tarmac, a cold 
December rain blowing hard in our faces. 

Hamerman, Jay Grayer, and I had gotten off Air Force One together. 

During the plane ride we sat together, planning how to protect President Byrnes from an 
assassination attempt in New of the ride. 

"We're traveling in the car directly behind the President. We can continue our little chat 
on the way into Manhattan," Hamerman said to me. 

We climbed into a somber, blue Lincoln Town Car that was parked less than fifty yards 
from the jet. It was close to ten in the evening, and that part of the airfield had been 
secured. 

There were Secret Service men, FBI agents, and New York City policemen milling 
around everywhere. 

Surrounding the five limousines of the presidential motorcade were at least three dozen 
NYPD blue-and-white squad cars, not to mention a few Harley motorcycles. The Secret 
Service agents stared into the foggy night as if Jack and Jill might suddenly appear on the 
runway at La Guardia. 

I had learned that the NYPD would have a minimum of five thousand uniformed officers 
on the special-service detail for the length of the President's visit. More than a hundred 
detectives would also be assigned. The Secret Service had tried to convince the President 
to stay at the Coast Guard base on Governors Island, or at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. 
The President had insisted on making a statement by staying in Manhattan. No regrets. 

His words in the Oval Office played over and over in my head. 

I settled back into the cushy and comfortable leather seat of the town car. I could sense 
the power. What it was like to ride in a motorcade directly behind the President's car, 
which the Secret Service called "Stagecoach." 

A couple of NYPD police cruisers pulled out in front of the pack. Their red and yellow 
roof lights began to revolve in quick kaleidoscopic circles. The presidential motorcade 
started to wind its way out of La Guardia Airport. 

Don Hamerman spoke as soon as we were moving. "No one has seen Kevin Hawkins in 
the past three days, right? Hawkins seems to have fallen off the face of the earth," he 


said. His voice was full of frustration, anger, and the usual petulance. He enjoyed 
bullying people beneath him, but neither Grayer nor I would put up with it. 

"No one knows the route we're taking," Hamerman said. "We didn't have a final route 
until a few minutes ago." 

I couldn't keep quiet. "We know the route. People in the NYPD know it, or they will 
momentarily. Kevin Hawkins is good at uncovering secrets. Kevin Hawkins is good, 
period. He's one of our best." 

Jay Grayer was peering out of the rain-streaked window into the fast lane of the New 
York highway we were traveling on. His voice sounded far away. "What's your instinct 
about Hawkins?" he asked me. 

"I think Kevin Hawkins is definitely involved somehow. 

He's extreme right-wing. He's associated with some groups that are opposed to the 
President's policies and plans. He's been in trouble before. He's suspected of a homicide 
inside the CIA. It all fits." 

"But something's bothering you about him?" Grayer asked. 

He'd learned how to read me pretty well already. 

"According to everything I've read, he's never worked closely with anyone before. 
Hawkins has always been a loner, at least until now. He seems to have problems relating 
to women, other than his sister in Silver Spring. I don't understand how Jill would fit in 
with him. I don't see Hawkins suddenly working with a woman." 

"Maybe he finally found a soul mate. It happens," Hamerman said. I doubted that 
Hamerman ever had. 

"What else pops out about Hawkins?" Jay Grayer continued to probe. He shut his eyes as 
he listened. 

"All his FBI psych profiles and workups suggest a potential loose cannon. I don't know 
how they justified keeping him active for all those years in Asia and South America. 
Here's the interesting part. Hawkins can get committed to causes that he believes in, 
though. He strongly believes in the importance of intelligence for our national defense. 
President Byrnes doesn't, and he's said so publicly several times. That could explain the 
Jack and Jill scenario. 

Could explain it. Hawkins is experienced and resourceful enough to pull off an 
assassination. He definitely could be Jack. 

If he is, he will be very hard to stop." 


We were starting to cross the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge into Manhattan. New York, New 
York. The presidential motorcade was a strange, eerie parade of wailing sirens and bright 
flashing lights. The island of Manhattan lay straight ahead of us. 

New York looked amazingly huge and imposing, capable of swallowing us whole. 
Anything can happen here, I was thinking, and I'm sure Don Hamerman and Jay Grayer 
were, too. 

Bam! 

Bam! 

Bam! 

The three of us jumped forward in the backseat of the town car. I had my hand on my 
gun, ready for almost anything, ready for Jack and Jill. 

We all stared in horror at the President's car up ahead -- Stagecoach. There was total 
silence in our car. Awful silence. Then we began to laugh. 

The loud noises hadn't been gunshots. They just sounded like it. They were false alarms. 
But it was chilling all the same. 

We had passed over worn and warped metal gratings on the ramp coming off the bridge. 
Everyone in our car had experienced an instant heart attack at the sudden and unexpected 
noise. Undoubtedly, the same thing had happened in the President's car. 

"Jesus," Hamerman moaned loudly "That's what it would be like. Oh, God Almighty" 

"I was there at the Washington Hilton when Hinckley shot Reagan and Brady," Jay 
Grayer said with a tremor in his voice. 

I knew that he was back there once again, with Reagan and James Brady Experiencing a 
flashback, the kind no one wanted to have. 

I wondered about Grayer's personal stake in this. I wondered about everybody on our 
team. 

I watched the President's car as it swept down onto the crowded, brightly lit streets of 
New York City. The American flags on the fenders were flapping wildly in the river 
breeze. 

No regrets. 


THE PHOTOJOURNALIST had arrived early on Monday, December 16, for his work in 
New York. 

He had decided to drive from Washington. It was much safer that way. Now he walked 
along Park Avenue, where the presidential motorcade would travel tomorrow morning, 
only a few hours from now. He was relaxing before the historic day, taking in the sights 
and sounds of New York City in the holiday season. 

Kevin Hawkins had occasional flashes, mind photos of memorabilia he had studied on 
the JFK killing, the murders of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, even the badly 
botched shooting of Ronald Reagan. 

He knew one thing for certain: this particular assassination wouldn't be botched. This 
was a done deal. There was no way out for Thomas Byrnes. No escape. 

He was closing in on the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he knew the President and his 
wife would be staying. It was typical for this president to go against the advice of his 
security advisors. 

It fit his profile perfectly. 

Don't listen to the experts. Fix what isn't broken. Arrogant fool, useless bastard. Traitor 
to the American people. 

The night was cool and fine, the light rain having finally stopped. The air felt good 
against his skin. He was certain that he wasn't going to be spotted as Kevin Hawkins. 
He'd taken care of that. There were easily a couple of hundred NYPD uniforms around 
the hotel. It didn't matter. No one would recognize him now. Not even his own mother 
and father. 

The picturesque divided avenue outside the hotel was relatively crowded at this time of 
night. Some spectators had come in hopes of seeing the President shot. They didn't 
know when the President would be arriving, but they knew the likely hotels in midtown. 
The Waldorf was a good guess. 

The local tabloids, and even the New York Times, had run huge headlines about Jack and 
Jill and the ongoing drama. In typical fashion, the press had gotten it mostly wrong -- but 
that would be helpful to him soon. 

Kevin Hawkins joined in with the strangely noisy and almost festive crowd, several of 
whom had wandered over from holiday visits to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. 
The unruly ambulance-chasers gathered outside the hotel told smugly ironic jokes, and he 
despised them for their big-city cynicism, their attitude. 

He despised them even more than the useless president he had come to this city to kill. 


He stayed at the outer edge of the crowd, just in case he suddenly had to move fast. He 
didn't want to be around there too late, but the presidential motorcade was running behind 
the schedule he had, the schedule he had been given. 


Finally, he saw heads and necks in the crowd craning to the far left. He could hear the 
roar of cars coming up Park Avenue. The motorcade was approaching the hotel. It had 
to be the motorcade coming. 


The dozen or so cars stopped at the canopied entrance on Park Avenue. Then Kevin 


Hawkins almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. 
The arrogant bastard had chosen to walk inside from the street rather than use the 
underground garage. He wanted to be seen -to be photographed. He wanted to show his 
courage to all the world... to show that Thomas Byrnes wasn't afraid of Jack and Jill. 


The photojournalist watched the cocksure and vainglorious chief executive as he was 
ushered from his limousine. He could have taken out Thomas Byrnes right there! Once 
the hotshot, former automobile executive had made the decision to return the presidency 
to "business as usual," the assassination was virtually guaranteed. 


Amateurs made such amateurish decisions, Hawkins knew. Always. 
It was a fact that he counted on in his work. 
I could do him right now. I could take out the President right here on Park Avenue. 
How does that make me feel? Excited--pumped. No guilt. 
What a strange man I have become, Kevin Hawkins thought. 
That was really why he was there that night- to test his emotional responses. 
This was his dress rehearsal for the big event. The only rehearsal he would need, or get. 
The Secret Service team smoothly and expertly got the President safely inside the hotel. 


Their coverage was excellent. Three tight rings around the PP, the protected person. 
The presidential detail was very good, but not good enough. 
No one could be. Not for what Kevin Hawkins had in mind. 
A kamikaze attack! A suicide attack. The President would not be able to escape from it. 


No one could. It was a done deal. 



He watched the rest of the shiny blue and black sedans unload, and he recognized nearly 
every face. He took his usual mind photos. Dozens of shots to remember -- all inside his 
head. 

Finally, he saw Jill. She looked so cool and utterly unconcerned. 

She was such a great psycho in her own right, wasn't she? 

Jill stood there in the middle of all the fuss and bustle. Then she disappeared inside the 
Waldorf with the rest of them. 

The photojournalist finally sauntered away, down Park toward what had once been the 
Pan Am Building and now belonged to MetLife. A float with Snoopy driving Santa's 
sleigh stood out on the building's rooftop. 

The President ought to buy some term life insurance tonight, he thought, whatever the 
price. The assassination is as good as done. 

It was guaranteed. 

But what Kevin Hawkins didn't even suspect, didn't realize, was that he too was being 
watched. He was under close observation, at that very moment, in New York City. 

Jack was watching Kevin Hawkins stroll down Park Avenue. 

JACK BE NIMBLEST. 

Jack be quickest. 

After he had watched Kevin Hawkins disappear on Park Avenue, Sam Harrison left the 
crowded area near the Waldorf. New York was already as stirred up about Jack and Jill 
as Washington, D.C. That was good. It would make everything easier. 

There was something he had to do now. He had to do this, no matter what the risks. It 
was the most important thing to him. 

At the corner of Lexington Avenue and Forty-seventh Street, he stopped at a pay phone 
booth. Surprisingly, the damn contraption actually worked. Maybe the only one that did 
in midtown. 

As he dialed, he watched a garish street hooker plying her trade across Lexington. 
Nearby, a middle-aged gay man was picking up a blond teenager. Urban cowboys and 
girls sashayed into a peculiar New York bar called Ride'm High. He mourned for the old 
New York, for America as it had been, for real cowboys and real men. 


He had important and necessary work to do in New York. Jack and Jill was heading 
toward its climax. He was confident that the real truth would go to his grave with him. It 
had to be like that. 

The truth had always been far too dangerous for the public to know. The truth didn't 
usually set people free, it just got them crazier. 

Most people just couldn't handle the truth. 
He finally reached a number in Maryland. There was a very small risk in the phone call, 
but he had to take it. He had to do this one thing for his own sanity. 


A little girl's voice came on the phone. Immediately, he felt the most incredible relief, 
but also a joy he hadn't experienced in days. The girl sounded as if she were right there 
in New York. 

"This is Karon speaking. How may I help you?" she said. 
He had taught her to answer the phone. 
He closed his eyes tight, and all of New York's depressing tawdriness, everything he was 


about to do was suddenly, effectively, shut out. Even Jack and Jill was gone from his 


thoughts for the briefest of moments. He was in a safety zone. He was home. 
His little girl was what really counted for him now. She was the only thing that mattered. 
She'd been permitted to wait up late for his call. 


He wasn't Jack as he cradled the phone receiver against his chin. 
He wasn't Sam Harrison. 
"It's Daddy," he said to his youngest child. "Hello, pumpkin-eater. 
I miss you to bits. How are you? Where's Mommy?" he asked. "Are you guys taking 


good care of each other? I'll be home real soon. Do you miss me? I sure miss you." 


He had to get away. with this, he thought as he talked to his daughter, and then to his 
wife. Jack and Jill had to succeed. 
He had to change history. He couldn't go home in a body bag. In disgrace. As the worst 


American traitor since Benedict Arnold. 
No, the body bag was for President Thomas Byrnes. He deserved to die. So had all the 
others. They were all traitors in their own way Jack and Jill came to The Hill To kill, to 
kill, to kill. 



And soon -- very soon -- it would be finished. 

SOMETHING was clearly wrong at the hotel. We hadn't been at the Waldorf for more 
than a few minutes when I knew there was a serious breach in security I could see the 
way the Secret Service agents closed around President Byrnes and his wife as they 
entered the glittery hotel foyer. 

Thomas and Sally Byrnes were hurriedly being escorted to their suite of rooms on the 
twenty-first floor. I knew the drill by heart. NYPD detectives had been working closely 
with the Secret Service detail. They had checked every conceivable and inconceivable 
method of infiltration into the Waldorf, including subways, sewers, and all the 
underground passages. Bomb-sniffing dogs had been marched through the midtown 
hotel just before our arrival. The dogs had also been taken that afternoon to the Plaza and 
the Pierre, other possible choices for the President's stay 

"Alex." I heard from behind. "Alex, over here. In here, Alex." 

Jay Grayer beckoned with his hand. "We've got a little problem already I don't know 
how they managed it, but they're definitely here in New York. Jack and Jill are here." 

"What the hell is going on here, Jay?" I asked the Secret Service agent as we hurried past 
glass cases filled with quart-size perfume bottles and expensive clothing accessories. 

Jay Grayer led me to the hotel's administrative offices, which were directly behind the 
front desk on the lobby floor. The room was already filled with Secret Service, FBI 
agents, and New York City police honchos. Everybody seemed to be listening to 
earphones or hand transmitters. They looked stressed-out, including the hotel 
management, with their own director of security and the proud claim that every president 
since Hoover had stayed at the Waldorf. 

Grayer finally turned to me and said, "A delivery of flowers came about ten minutes ago. 
They're from our friends Jack and Jill. There's another rhyme with the flowers." 

"Let's take a look at it. Let me see the message, please." 

The note was on a mahogany desk next to an arrangement of blood-red roses. I read it as 
Grayer looked over my shoulder. 

Jack and Jill went up The Hill And surprised the Chief with flowers. 

We're here in town We're counting down Your last remaining hours. 

"They want us to believe they're a couple of kooks," I said to Jay 

"Do you?" 


"I sure as hell don't, but they're sticking with it. It's consistent as hell and it's all a plan. 
They definitely know what they're doing, and we definitely don't." 

And Jack and Jill were definitely in New York City THE HEAVY WOODEN DOOR 
into President Thomas Byrnes's master bedroom opened at a few minutes past midnight. 
The Waldorf's presidential suite consisted of four bedrooms and two sitting rooms in the 
tower portion of the hotel. No other hotel guests were staying on that floor, or the floors 
immediately above and below. 

"Who is it?" The President looked up from the book he was reading to try and calm his 
nerves. The book was the massive Truman by David McCullough. The President nearly 
dropped the heavy tome when the door opened unexpectedly Thomas Byrnes smiled 
when he saw who was standing between the doorway and a large antique armoire. 

"Oh, it's you. I thought it might be Jill. I think she secretly likes me. Just a gut feeling I 
have," he said and chuckled. 

Sally Byrnes forced a smile. "Only me. I wanted to say goodnight. And to see if you 
were all right, Tom." 

The President looked fondly at his wife. They had been sleeping in separate bedrooms 
for the past few years. They'd had problems. 

But they were still close friends. He believed they still loved each other, and always 
would. 

"You didn't come to tuck me in?" he asked. "That's a shame." 

"Of course I did. That, too. Tonight, you deserve a tuck-in." 

Her husband smiled in a way that reminded both of them of better times, much better 
times. He could be a charmer when he wanted to be. Sally Byrnes knew that all too well. 
Tom could also be a major heartbreaker. Sally knew that, too. It had been that way for 
most of their years together. The agony and the ecstasy, she called the relationship. In 
truth, though, to be fair, it had been more ecstasy than agony They both believed that, and 
knew what they had was rare. 

Thomas Byrnes lightly patted the edge of the bed, which was king-size with a partial 
canopy Sally came and sat beside him. He reached for her hand, and she gave it to him 
willingly She loved to hold hands with her Tom. She always had. She knew she still 
loved him in spite of past hurts and all their other troubles. She could forgive him for his 
affairs. She knew they meant nothing to him. She was secure in herself. Sally Byrnes 
also understood her husband better than anybody else. She knew how disturbed he was 
right now, how deeply frightened, and how vulnerable. 


And she did love him, the whole complex package -- the arrogance, the diffidence, the 
insecurities, the very large ego at times. 


She knew that he loved her and that they would always be best friends and soul mates. 
"Tell you something weird," he said as he pulled her closer, as he tenderly held his wife 
of twenty-six years. 


"Tell me. I expect nothing less than full disclosure, Mr. King." 


It was a phrase they had both laughed over in the London stage play The Madness of 
George IlL The queen had called George III "Mr. King" in bed. 
"I think it's somebody we know. I had a talk about it with that homicide detective. He's 


the only one who had the balls to come to me with bad news. I think it could be 


somebody close to us, Sally That makes it all the more horrible." 
Sally Byrnes tried not to show her fear. Her eyes traveled up and around the high-
ceilinged bedroom. There was a chair rail halfway up the walls. Baby-blue-and-cream 
wallpaper rose above the rail. God, how she wished they could go home to Michigan. 


That's what she really wanted more than anything, for her and Tom to go back home. 
"Have you told that to Don Hamerman?" 
"I'm telling you," he whispered. "You, I can trust. You, I do trust." 
Sally kissed his forehead softly, then his cheek, and finally his lips. "You sure about 


that?" 


"Hundred percent," he whispered. "Although you have some good reasons to want to get 
me. Better reasons than most. Better than Jack and Jill, I'll bet." 
"Hold me tight," she said. "Don't ever let go." 
"Hold me tight," the President continued to whisper to his wife. "Don't you ever let go. I 


could stay like this with you forever. 
And please, Sally, forgive me." 
It's somebody close. It's somebody very close to me. President Thomas Byrnes couldn't 


turn off the disturbing thought as he held his wife. Somebody close. 
"What would you like for Christmas, Tom? You know the press -- they always want to 
know." 



President Byrnes thought for a moment. 

"Peace. For this to be over." 

IT WAS TIME to prove he was better than Jack and Jill. In his heart, he knew that he 
was. No contest. Jack and Jill were basically full of crap. 

The Cross house stood in dark, shifting shadows on Fifth Street in Washington's 
Southeast. It looked as if everyone inside had finally fallen asleep. We'll soon see. We'll 
just see about that, the killer thought to himself. 

His name was Danny Boudreaux, if you really wanted to know the truth. He watched the 
streetlamp-lit scene from a clump of gum trees sprouting in an otherwise empty lot. 

He was thinking about how much he hated Cross and his family. Alex Cross reminded 
him of his real father, who'd also been a cop devoted to his stupid job and who had left 
him and his mother because of it. Deserted them as if they were so much spit on the 
sidewalk. Then his mother had killed herself and he'd wound up with foster parents. 

Families made him sick, but bigshot Cross tried to be such a perfect daddy He was such a 
phony, a real scam artist. Worse than that, Cross had severely underestimated him and 
also "dissed" him several times. 

Danny Boudreaux had been a classmate of Sumner Moore at Theodore Roosevelt. 
Sumner Moore had always been the perfect suck-up cadet, the perfect student, the perfect 
student-athlete asshole. Moore had been his goddamn tutor since the previous summer. 
Danny Boudreaux had to go to the Moore house twice a week. He'd hated Sumner 
Moore from day one for being such a condescending and stuck-up little prick. He'd hated 
the whole condescending Moore family Well, he'd taught them a lesson. 

He'd turned out to be the tutor. 

His first totally outrageous idea had been to make it look as if Sumner Moore, the perfect 
cadet, were the child killer. He'd logged into the Moore's Prodigy account and led the 
cops right to their house. What a great frigging prank that had been -- the best. Then 
he'd decided to get rid of Sumner. That was the second outrageous idea. He'd enjoyed 
killing Sumner Moore even more than the little kids. 

''He wanted to teach Cross a lesson now, too. Cross obviously didn't think the so-called 
Sojourner Truth School killer was worth much of his precious time. Danny Boudreaux 
was no Gary Soneji in the eyes of Alex Cross. He was no Jack and Jill. He was Nobody, 
right? 

Well, we'll see about that, Dr. Cross. We'll just see how I stack up against Jack and Jill 
and the others. Watch this one real closely, Doctor Hotshit Defective. You just might 
learn something. 


In the next hour or so, a lot of people would learn not to underestimate Danny 
Boudreaux, not to snub him ever again. 

Danny Boudreaux crossed Fifth Street, careful to keep his body in tree shadows. He 
walked right into the well-kept yard that bordered the Cross house. 

He was thirteen, but small for his age. He was five three and only a hundred and ten 
pounds. He didn't look like much. The other cadets called him Mister Softee because he 
would melt into tears whenever they teased him, which was just about all the time. 

For Danny Boudreaux hell week had lasted the whole school year. 

No, it had lasted for his entire life so far. Christ, he had enjoyed killing Sumner Moore! 
It was like killing his whole goddamn school] 

He smeared gray eye shadow over his face, his neck, and his hands as he waited across 
from the Cross house. He had on dark jeans and a black shirt, and also a dark camo face 
mask made by Treebark. He had to fit in with the African-American neighborhood, 
right? Well, no one had paid much attention to him on Sixth Street, or even walking 
along E Street on his way to Fifth. 

Danny Boudreaux touched the butt of the Smith & Wesson semiautomatic in the deep 
pocket of his poncho. The gun held a dozen shots. He was loaded for bear. The safety 
was off. He started crying again. Hot tears were streaming down his face. He wiped 
them away with his sleeve. No more Mr. Softee. 

He did perfect murders. 

NOTHING IN HEAVEN or on earth could save Alex Cross's cute little family now. 
They were next in line to die. It was the move he had to make. The right move at the 
right time. Hey, hey, what do you say ? 

Danny Boudreaux inched his way up the back-porch steps of the house. He didn't make a 
freaking sound. 

He could be a damn good cadet when he needed to be. A fine young soldier. He was on 
maneuvers tonight, that's all it was. He was on a nocturnal mission. 

Search and destroy. 

He didn't hear any noises coming from inside the house. No late-night TV sounds. No 
Letterman, Leno, and Beavis and Butt-head, NordicTrack commercials. No piano 
playing, either. That probably meant Cross was sleeping now, too. So be it. The sleep 
of the dead, right ? 


He touched the doorknob and immediately wanted to pull his fingers away The metal felt 
like dry ice against his skin. He held on, though. He turned the knob slowly, slowly 
Then he pulled it toward him. 

The goddamn door was locked! For some crazy reason he'd imagined it wouldn't be. He 
could still get in the house through this door, but he might make some noise. 
That wouldn't do. 
That wasn't perfect. 
He decided to go around front and check the situation there. 
He knew there was a sun porch. A piano on the porch. Cross played the blues out there 


- but the blues were only just beginning for the good doctor. After tonight, the rest of his 
life would be nothing but the blues. 
Still no sound came from inside the house. He knew Cross hadn't moved his family out 
of harm's way That showed more disrespect on his part. Cross wasn't afraid of him. Well, 
he ought to be afraid. Dammit, Cross ought to be scared shitless of him! 


Danny Boudreaux reached out to try the door to the sun porch. The young killer broke 
out in a sweat. Boudreaux could hardly breathe. He was seeing his worst nightmare, and 
his nightmares were really bad. 


Detective John Sampson was staring right at him! The black giant was there on the 
porch. Waiting for him. Sitting there, all smug as hell. 
He'd been caught!Jesus. They'd set a trap for him. He'd fallen for it like a true chump. 


But, hey, wait a damn minute. Wait a minute! 
Something was wrong with this picture... or rather something was very right with the 
picture! 


Danny Boudreaux blinked his eyes, then he stared real hard. 


He concentrated hard. Sampson was sleeping in the big, fluffy armchair next to the 
piano. 
His stockinged feet were propped up on a matching hassock. 
His holstered gun was on a small side table, maybe twelve inches from his right hand. 


His holstered gun. 
Twelve inches. Hmmm. Just twelve little inches, the killer thought, mulled it over. 



Danny Boudreaux held on to the doorknob for dear life. He didn't move. His chest hurt 
as if he'd been punched. 


What to do? What to do? What in hell to do?... TWELVE MEASLY INCHES... 
His mind was going about a million miles a second. There were so many thoughts 
blasting through his brain that it almost shut down on him. 


He wanted to go at Sampson. To rush in and take the big moke out. Then hurry upstairs 
and do the family. He wanted it so much that the thought burned in him, scared the 
inside of his brain, fried his thought waves. 


He slid in and out of his military mind. The better part of valor and all that shit. Logic 


conquers all. He knew what he had to do. 
Even more slowly than he'd come up the steps, he backed away from the porch door of 
the Cross house. He couldn't believe how close he'd come to stumbling right into the 
huge, menacing detective. 


Maybe he could have snuck up on the big moke -- blown his brains out. Maybe not, 


though. The big moke was a really big moke. 
No, the Truth School killer wouldn't take the chance. He had too much fun, too many 
games, ahead of him to blow it like this. 


He was too experienced now. He was getting better and better at this. 
He disappeared into the night. He had other choices, other business, he could take care 


of. Danny Boudreaux was on the loose in D.C., and he loved it. He had a taste for it 
now. There would be time for Cross and his stupid family later. 
He'd already forgotten that just minutes before he had been crying his eyes out. He hadn't 

taken his medicine in seven days. 
The hated, despicable Depakote, his goddamn mood-disorder medicine. 
He was wearing his favorite sweatshirt again. Happy, happy. 
Joy, joy. 
I WOKE WITH A START and a trembling shiver. My skin was prickling, my heart 


racing furiously. 
Bad dream? Something unholy, real, or imagined? The room was pitch-black, all the 
lights out, and it took me a second to remember where in the name of God I was. 


Then I remembered. I remembered everything. I was part of the team assigned to try and 
protect the President- except the President had decided to make our job even harder than 
it had been. The President had decided to travel out of Washington m to show the colors- 
to demonstrate that he wasn't afraid of terrorists and crackpots of any kind. 

I was in New York City m at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue. Jack and Jill 
were in New York, too. They were so sure of themselves that they had sent us a calling 
card. 

I groped around for the lamp on the bedside table, then for the damn lamp switch. 
Finally, I clicked it on. I looked at the night table clock. Two fifty-five. 

"That's just terrific," I whispered under my breath. "That's great." 

I thought of calling my kids in Washington. Calling Nana. It wasn't a real serious idea, 
but the notion floated across my mind. 

I thought about Christine Johnson. Calling her at home. Absolutely not! But I did have 
the thought, and I did like the idea of talking to her on the phone. 

I finally pulled on a pair of khakis, stepped into battered Converse sneaks, slipped into an 
old sweatshirt. I wandered out into the hotel. I needed to be out of my hotel room. I 
needed to be out of my own skin. 

The Waldorf-Astoria was sound asleep. As it should be. Except that very uptight Secret 
Service agents were posted everywhere! in every hallway where I wandered. The 
presidential detail was on its night watch. They were mostly athletic-looking men, who 
reminded me of very fit accountants. Only a couple of women were assigned to the detail 
in New York. 

"You going for a late walk through midtown New York, Detective Cross?" one of the 
Secret Service agents asked as I passed by. 

It was a woman named Camille Robinson. She was serious and very dedicated, as most 
of the Secret Service agents seemed to be. They seemed to like President Thomas Byrnes 
a lot, enough to take a bullet for. 

"My mind is up and mnning, for sure," I said and managed a smile. "Probably do a couple 
of marathons before morning. You okay? Need some coffee or anything?" 

Camille shook her head and kept her serious face on. Watchdogs can be female, too. I'd 
met my share of them. I saluted the diligent agent, then kept on walking. 

A few thoughts continued to plague me as I wandered inside the eerily quiet hotel. My 
mind was running way too hot. 


The murder of Charlotte Kinsey was one disturbing puzzle piece. 

That murder might have been committed by somebody other than Jack and Jill. Could 
there be a third killer? Why would there be a third killer? How did it fit? 

I continued down another long hallway, and down still another track in my mind. 

What about larger and more complicated conspiracies? Dallas and JFK? Los Angeles 
and RFK? Memphis and Dr. King? 

Where did that insane and depressing line of thinking take me? 

The list of possible conspirators was impossibly long, and I didn't have the resources to 
get at most of the suspects, anyway. The crisis group talked about conspiracies a lot. 
The Federal Bureau was obsessed with conspiracies. So was the CIA... but a powerful 
fact remained: thirty years after the Kennedy assassinations, no one was really convinced 
that either of those murders had been solved. 

The more I delved into conspiracy theories, the more I realized that getting to the core 
was almost impossible. Certainly, no one had yet. I'd talked to several people at the 
Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington, and they had come to 
exactly the same conclusion. Or dead end. 

I wandered into the hallway on the twenty-first floor, where the President was sleeping. I 
had a chilling thought that he might be dead in his room; that Jack and Jill had already 
struck and left a note, another poem for us to discover in the morning. 

"Everything okay?" I asked the agents stationed just outside the door of the presidential 
suite. 

They watched me carefully, as if they were asking themselves, Why is he here? "So far," 
one of them said stiffly. "No problems here." 

Eventually, I made it full circle back to my room. It was almost four in the morning. 

I slipped inside the room. Lay down on the bed. I thought of my conversation with 
Sampson earlier that night, hearing about the murder of Sumner Moore. Apparently, the 
Moore boy wasn't the Truth School killer. I tried not to think about either case anymore. 

I finally dozed until six -- when the clock radio went off like a fire alarm next to my head. 

Rock-and-roll music blared. "K-Rock" in New York. Howard Stem was talking to me. 
He had worked down in Washington years ago. Howard said, "The prez is in town. Can 
Jack and Jill be far away?" 


Everybody knew about it. The President's motorcade through Manhattan started at 
eleven. Stagecoach was ready to roll again. 

HISTORY was about to be made in New York City. At the very least, it was white-
knuckle time. Definitely that. The game had ceased being a game. 

Jack jogged at a strong, steady pace through Central Park. It was a little before six in the 
morning. He'd been out running since just after five. He had a lot on his mind. D day 
had finally arrived. New York City was the war zone, and he couldn't imagine a better 
one. 

He observed the very striking Manhattan skyline from where he was running alongside 
Fifth Avenue, heading south. Above the tall, uneven line of buildings, the sky was the 
color of charcoal seen through tissue paper. Huge plumes of smoke billowed up from 
turn-of-the-century buildings. 

It was pretty as hell, actually. Close to glorious. Not the way he usually thought of New 
York City. It was just a facade, though. 

Like Jack and Jill, he was thinking. 

As he ran alongside a blue city bus chargang down Fifth Avenue, he wondered if he 
might die in the next few hours. He had to be ready for that, to be prepared for anything. 

Kamikaze, he thought. The final plan was deadly, and it was as surefire as these things 
could be. He didn't believe that the target could possibly survive this attack. No one 
could. There would be other deaths as well. This was a war, after all, and people died in 
war. 

Jack finally emerged from the park at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth. 

He continued to run south, picking up his pace. 

A few moments later, he entered the formal and attractive lobby of the Peninsula Hotel in 
the West Fifties. It was ten past six in the morning. The Peninsula was a little more than 
twenty blocks from Madison Square Garden, where President Byrnes was scheduled to 
appear at twenty-five past eleven. The New York Times was just being delivered into the 
hotel lobby He caught the headline: JACK AND JILL KILLERS FEARED IN NEW 
YORK AS PRESIDENT VISITS. 

He was impressed. Even the Times was on top of things. 

Then Jack saw Jill. Jill was right on time in the lobby. Always on time. She was at the 
Peninsula according to plan. Always according to plan. 


She had on a silver-and-blue jogging suit, but she didn't look as if she'd raised a sweat 
coming up from the Waldorf. He wondered if she had run or walked. Or maybe even 
caught a Yellow Cab. 

He didn't acknowledge her in any way He stepped into a waiting elevator and took it to 
his floor. Sara would take the next elevator. 

He let himself into his room and waited for her. A single knock on the door. She was on 
schedule. Less than sixty seconds behind him. 

"I look terrible," she said. Sara's first words. It was so typical of her self-effacing tone, 
her view of herself, her vulnerability Sara the poor gimp. 

"No, you don't," he reassured her. "You look beautiful, because you are beautiful." She 
didn't look her best, though. She was showing the terrible strain of these last hours. Her 
face was a mask of worry and doubt, too much makeup and mascara and bright red 
lipstick. D day. She'd sprayed her blond hair, and it looked brittle. 

"The Waldorf is hopping already," she reported to him. "They think an assassination 
attempt definitely will be made today They're ready for it, at least they think they are. 
Five thousand regular New York police, plus the Secret Service, the FBI. They have an 
army on hand." 

"Let them think they're ready," Jack said. "We'll see soon enough, won't we? Now come 
here, you," he smiled. "You don't look terrible at all. Never happen. You look 
ravishing, Sara. May I ravage you?" 

"Now?" Sara weakly protested. It was a whisper. So tiny and vulnerable and unsure. 
But she couldn't resist his strong, reassuring embrace. She never had been able to, and 
that was part of the plan as well. Everything had been anticipated, which was why they 
couldn't fail. 

He slid out of his running shirt, exposing a glistening-wet chest. All the tufts of his hair 
were damp with sweat. He pressed up against Sara. She arched her body hard against 
him. Their pulses were racing. Jack and Jill. In New York. So close to the end. 

He could feel her heartbeat quickening, like a small hunted animal's. She couldn't help it. 
She was so scared now, legitimately so. 

"Please tell me that we'll see each other again, even if we won't. 

Tell me it isn't over after today, Sam." 

"It won't be over, Monkey Face. I'm as frightened as you are right now. To feel this way 
is normal, and sane. You're very sane. 


We both are." 


"In a few hours we'll be on our way out of New York. All of this Jack and Jill will be 
behind us," she whispered. "Oh, I do love you, Sam. I love you so much that it's scary." 
It was scary. More than Sara could possibly know. More than anybody ought to know, 


or ever would. History wasn't for the general public -- it never had been. 
Slowly and carefully, he slid a Ruger from the rear waistband of his sweatpants. His 


hands were sweaty He was holding his breath now. He placed the gun against Sara's 
head and fired at a slightly downward angle into her temple. Just one shot. 
A professional execution. 
Without passion. 
Almost without passion. 
The Ruger was silenced. The noise in the hotel room was no more than a tiny, 


insignificant spit. The harsh impact of the 9mm bullet took her out of his arms. He 


shivered involuntarily as he looked down on the lifeless body on the hotel rug. 
"Now it's over," he said. "The pain of your life is over, all the bitterness and hurt. I'm 
sorry, Monkey Face." 


He put the final note in Jill's right hand. Then he squeezed her fist so that the note 
crumpled naturally. He held Sara's hand for the last time. 
And Jill came tumbling after. He thought of the words in the children's rhyme. 
But Jack would not fall down. 
The day of ultimate madness had begun. 
Jack and Jill had finally begun. 
PART 6 


NOBODY IS SAFE ANYMORE-NOBODY 
THE THICK DOCUMENT in my hands was entitled Visit of the President of the United 
States. New York City, December 16 and 17. It ran to eighty-nine pages and included 
virtually every moment from when the President would step off Air Force One at La 
Guardia until he reboarded at approximately two in the afternoon and traveled back to 
Washington. 


Included among the pages were sketches, literally of everywhere the President would be: 
La Guardia Airport, the Waldorf, the Felt Forum inside Madison Square Garden, the 
motorcade routes, alternate routes. 

The Secret Service document stated: 

10:55 A.t The President and Mrs. Byrnes board motorcade Note: The President and Mrs. 
Byrnes proceed through a cordon of NYPD officers at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel 
11:00 A.M. Motorcade departs Waldorf via route (code C) to Madison Square Garden, 
the Felt Forum Closed arrival. 
No press pool coverage. 

I occupied my mind with the puzzle of Jack and Jill as the time approached for the 
President to leave the Waldorf and then travel downtown with the motorcade of 
limousines, police radio cars, and motorcycles. For the past three days, the FBI, Secret 
Service, and New York police had been cooperating on a massive plan to try and capture 
Jack and Jill if they actually came to Madison Square Garden. Nearly a thousand 
plainclothes agents and detectives would be inside for the President's speech. We all had 
doubts that it would be enough protection. 

A disturbing mania had been running through my head all morning: No one ever stops an 
assassin bullet. No one stops a bullet except the victim. 

What would Jack and Jill do? How would it go down? I believed they would be at 
Madison Square Garden. I suspected that they planned to do the job up close. And 
somehow, they planned to escape. 

The President and Mrs. Byrnes were escorted to their car at precisely five minutes to 
eleven. A phalanx of a dozen Secret Service agents shadowed them from the tower suite 
to an armor-plated limousine waiting in the hotel's underground garage. 

I walked closely behind the main escort group. My role here wasn't to physically protect 
the President. I had already told Jay Grayer how I believed the attempt would be made. 
It would be close in. It would be showy. But they would have a plan to escape. 

There had already been a change in plans that morning. No cordon of high-ranking 
policemen at the hotel rear entrance. No photo opportunities. The President had been 
convinced not to go through the open Waldorf lobby a second time. 

I watched as Mrs. Byrnes and the President walked into the limousine for the two-mile 
ride. The two of them held hands. It was a touching moment to witness. It fit with 
everything I knew about Thomas and Sally Byrnes. 

No regrets. 


The motorcade began to move right on time. It was what the Secret Service called "the 
formal package motorcade." There were twenty-eight cars. Six held counterassault 
teams. One Car, "Intelligence," held computers to keep contact with surveillance on 
known threats to the President. I wondered if Jack and Jill had the schedule, even the 
number of cars. 

The motorcade's limos and town cars rode at almost perpendicular angles out of the steep 
hotel garage. Manhole covers clattered loudly under our tires. The route to the 
auditorium began on Park Avenue, then jogged west along Forty-seventh Street to Fifth. 

I rode with Don Hamerman, two cars behind the President. 

Even Hamerman was subdued and distant that morning. Nothing had happened yet. 
Could Jack and Jill possibly have changed their plan? Was this part of covering their 
trail? Would they surface when we began to doubt that they would? Would they surprise 
me and attack the motorcade? 

I watched everything out the car window. The morning was an eerie, out-of-body 
experience. The people lining the street were enthusiastic, clapping and cheering as the 
motorcade passed by. That was one reason why President Byrnes had decided he 
couldn't hide in the White House any longer. The people, even New Yorkers, wanted a 
piece of him. He was a good president so far, a popular one, a courageous one, too. 

Who wanted to kill Thomas Byrnes, and why? There were so many potential enemies, 
but I kept returning to the President's own list. Senator Glass, Vice President Mahoney, a 
few reactionaries in Congress, powerful men connected to Wall Street. He had said that 
he was trying to change the system, and the system fiercely resented change. 

The system fiercely resented change! 

Police sirens wailed and seemed to be everywhere around us. 

It was a screaming wall of noise that was just right for the occasion. 

My eyes drifted back and forth between the cheering crowds and the quickly moving line 
of cars, the presidential motorcade. 

I was a part of it, and yet I also felt disconnected. I couldn't help thinking of Dallas, John 
Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. King. The past tragedies of our country. Our 
sorrowful history. 

I couldn't take my eyes off Stagecoach. 


It struck me as almost impossible, as unthinkable, that two of the three major 
assassinations remained mysterious and unsolved in most people's minds. Two of the 
three major murder cases of our century had never been satisfactorily cleared. 

The VIP garage underneath Madison Square Garden was a concrete bunker, which was 
painted bright white. There must have been a hundred Secret Service and New York 
police gathered there to meet us. The Secret Service agents all wore earphones that 
plugged them into the Service's cellular net. 

I watched Thomas and Sally Byrnes slowly get out of their armored car. I watched the 
President's eyes. He seemed steady and confident and focused. Maybe he knew exactly 
what he was doing; maybe his way was the only way for this to go. 

I was less than a dozen feet away from the President and his wife. Every second they 
were out in the open seemed an eternity There were too many people there in the parking 
garage. Any of them could be a killer. 

The President and Sally Byrnes were smiling, talking smoothly and easily to important 
well-wishers from New York. They were both very skilled at this. They understood the 
tremendously important ceremonial role of the office. The symbolism and the absolute 
power. That was why they were here. I very much liked their sense of duty and 
responsibility Nana was wrong about them. I was convinced they were decent people 
trying to do their best. I understood how difficult their jobs were. I hadn't realized this 
before I came to the White House. 

Nothing must happen to President Byrnes or Sally Byrnes, I thought -- as if an act of will 
could stop an assassin's bullet, stop terrible things from happening there in the garage or 
upstairs in the packed Felt Forum. 

Any one of these people could be Jack or Jill, I kept thinking as I watched the crowd. 

Get the President and his wife out of here. Do it now! Let go, let go. 

The Kennedy Center in D.C. The shooting of the law student, Charlotte Kinsey, in a 
public place, just like this! My mind kept going back to that particular killing. 

Something had happened there, something revealing about Jack and Jill. The pattern had 
been broken! What was the real pattern? 

We began to walk upstairs to the jam-packed auditorium. 

If Jack and Jill are willing to die, they can succeed here. Easily! 

And yet it seemed to me that they planned to get away with this. That was the one 
pattern of theirs that was consistent. I didn't see how that could happen in the middle of 
Madison Square Garden -- not if they chose to attack here. 


The real Jack and Jill -- the President and the First Lady of the United States had arrived. 
On time. 

A DROP OF SWEATslowly rolled off the tip of my nose. 

A tractor-trailer was sitting on my chest. 

The thunderous noise coming from inside the concrete-and-steel auditorium added to the 
escalating confusion and chaos. 

It was decibels beyond deafening once we were inside. Nearly ten thousand people had 
filled the auditorium by the time we arrived. 

I moved toward the main auditorium stage with the rest of the security entourage. Secret 
Service agents, FBI, U.S. marshals, and New York police were posted everywhere 
around the President. 

I searched everywhere for Kevin Hawkins. Hopefully, at his side, Jill. 

President Byrnes never let his smile or his step falter as he entered the auditorium. I 
remembered his words: "A threat by a couple of kooks can't be permitted to disrupt the 
government of the United States. We can't allow that to happen." 

It was warm in the building, but I was in a cold sweat -- as cold as the winds blowing off 
the Hudson River. We were less than thirty yards from the massive stage that was filled 
with celebrities and well-known politicians, including both the governor and the city's 
popular mayor. 

Cameras flashed blinding light everywhere, from every imaginable angle. Awhine of 
feedback lashed out from one of the stage microphones. I adjusted a five-pointed star on 
the left lapel of my suit jacket. The star was color-coded for the day. It identified me as 
part of the Secret Service team. The day's color was green. 

For hope? 

Jack and Jill had kept all their.promises so far. They could have found a way to get 
weapons inside. There were at least a thousand handguns, but also rifles and shotguns 
inside the huge amphitheater. The police and other security guards had them. 

Any one of them could be Jack or Jill. 

Any one of them certainly could be Kevin Hawkins. 

Don Hamerman was at my side, but it was too loud for us to talk in anything approaching 
normal tones. Occasionally, we leaned close and shouted into each other's ear. 


Even then, it was difficult to hear more than an isolated word or phrase. 
"He's taking too long to walk to the stage!" Hamerman said. I think that's what he said. 
"I know it. Tell me about it," I shouted back. 
"Watch the crowd movement," he yelled at me. "They'll stampede if they see a gun 


pulled. President's spending too much time out in the crowd. Is he taunting the killers? 


What does he think that he has to prove?" 
The chief of staff was right, of course. The President seemed to be daring Jack and Jill. 
Still, we might get lucky with the trap inside the crowded hall. 


Suddenly, the crowd did start to stampede! The crowd began to part. 


"Kill the son of a bitch! Kill him!" I heard the shouts a row or two ahead. I moved 
quickly, pushing, clawing my way forward in a hurry. 
"Watch it, you bastard !" a woman turned and yelled in my face. 
"Kill him now!" I heard up ahead. 
"Let me through? I shouted as loud as I could. 
The man who was causing the scene up ahead had shoulder-length blond hair. He wore a 


baggy black parka with a black backpack attached. 


I grabbed him at the same time as someone else from the other side of the aisle. We 
brought the blond man down hard and fast. 
His skull crunched against the cement floor. 
"New York police!" the other guy holding the blond man yelled. 
"D.C. police, White House detail," I yelled back. I was already patting down the 


suspect. The New York cop had his gun in the suspect's face. 
I didn't recognize the blond as Kevin Hawkins, but there was no way to tell for sure, and 


absolutely no way for us to take a chance on him. We had to take him down. There was 
no choice about that. 
"Kill the bastard! Kill the President!" the blond man continued to scream. 
He was absolutely crazy, everything was, not just this asshole on the floor. 



"You hurt me!" he started to yell at me and the New York cop. 

"You hurt my head!" 

Madman ? I wondered. 

Copycat? 

Diversion ? 

KAMIKAZE ATTACK! It was coming any second now. A killer willing to commit 
suicide. That was why this couldn't be stopped. It was also why President Byrnes was 
the walking dead. 

Kevin Hawkins hadn't experienced any problems getting into a prime position in the 
noisy, crowded auditorium. He had used his imagination and visual skills to create an 
unusual identity for himself. 

Hawkins was now a tall brunette woman dressed in a dark blue pantsuit. He wasn't a very 
good-looking woman, he had to admit, but he was much less likely to draw attention 
because of it. 

Hawkins also had a Federal Bureau of Investigation ID, which was authentic down to the 
stamp and thickness of the paper. It identified him as Lynda Cole, a special agent from 
New York. The photojournalist stood at Lynda Cole's seat in the sixth row and calmly 
observed the crowd. 

Snapshot. 

Snapshot. 

He took several mind photos, one after the other, mostly of his competition. The FBI, the 
Secret Service, the NYPD. Actually, he didn't believe that he had any real competition. 

Kamikaze. Who could stop that ? No one could. Maybe God could. 

And maybe not even God. 

He was impressed by the sheer numbers of the opposition, though. They were serious 
about trying to derail Jack and Jill this morning. And who knew? Maybe they would 
succeed with their superior numbers and firepower. Stranger things had happened. 

Hawkins just didn't believe that they could. Their last real chance had been before he'd 
gotten inside the building -- not now. The photojournalist versus the FBI, the Secret 
Service, the U.S. marshals, and the NYPD. That seemed reasonable enough to him. It 
seemed like a pretty fair game. 


Their elaborate preparations struck him as being ironic. He waited for the target to 
appear. Their game plan was an essential part of his. Everything they were doing now, 
every step, had been anticipated and was necessary for kamikaze to work. 

"She's a Grand Old Flag" began to play from the loudspeakers, and Hawkins clapped 
along with the others. He was a patriot, after all. No one might believe it after today, but 
he knew that it was so. 

Kevin Hawkins was one of the last true patriots. 

NO ONE stops an assassin bullet. 

There was a fire burning inside my chest. I was moving quickly through the crowd -- 
searching for Kevin Hawkins everywhere. 

Every nerve in my body was stretched tight and burning. My right hand rested on the 
hard butt of my Glock. I kept thinking that any one of these people could be Jack or Jill. 
The handgun seemed insubstantial in the huge, noisy crowd. 

I had made it to the second row, just to the right of the ten- to twelve-foot-high stage. 
The light in the hall seemed to be fading, but maybe it was the light inside my head. The 
light inside my soul? 

The President was just stepping onto the gray metal stairs. 

He clasped the hand of a well-wisher. The President patted the shoulder of another. He 
seemed to have forced the idea of danger out of his mind. 

Sally Byrnes climbed the stairs in front of her husband. I could see her features clearly I 
held the thought that maybe Jack and Jill could, too. Secret Service agents seemed to 
take up all the available space around the stage. 

I was there when it finally happened. I was so close. 

Jack and Jill struck with a terrible vengeance. 

A bomb went off. The loudest imaginable clap of thunder struck near the stage- maybe 
even on the stage itself. The explosion was completely unexpected by the bodyguards 
surrounding the President. It detonated inside the defense perimeter. 

Chaos! A bomb instead of gunfire! Even though the auditorium had been swept for 
bombs just that morning, I was thinking as I rushed forward. I noticed that my hand was 
bleeding -- probably from the earlier tussle with the nutcase, but maybe from the bomb. 


The worst imaginable sequence of actions began to unfold, and in very fast motion. 
Pistols and riot-control shotguns were pulled out everywhere in the crowd. No one 
seemed to know where the bomb had hit yet, or how, or the actual calculations of damage 
done. Or what purpose the explosion was meant to serve? 

Everyone dropped to the floor in the first twenty rows and up on the stage. 

Thick black smoke billowed toward the ceiling, the glass roof, and overhanging steel 
girders. 

The air smelled like human hair burning. People were screaming everywhere. I couldn't 
tell how many were hurt. I couldn't see the President anymore. 

The bomb had detonated close to the stage. Very close to where President Byrnes had 
been standing, shaking hands and chatting, just a few seconds before. The ringing was 
still vibrating in my ears. 

I frantically pushed my way toward the stage. There was no way to tell how many people 
had been injured, or maybe even killed, by the blast. I still couldn't locate the President 
or Mrs. Byrnes because of the smoke and the bodies suddenly in frenzied motion. TV 
cameramen were wading in toward the disaster scene. 

I finally spotted a cluster of Secret Service agents huddled tightly around the President. 
They had him up on his feet. 

Thomas Byrnes was alive; he was safe. The agents were starting to move him out of 
harm's way The Secret Service bodyguards acted as a human shield for the President, 
who didn't appear to be hurt. 

I had my Glock out, pointed up at the rafters for safety I shouted, "Police!" 

Several other Secret Service agents and NYPD detectives were doing the same thing. We 
were identifying ourselves to one another. 

Trying not to get shot, trying not to shoot anybody else during the terrifying confusion. 
Several people in the crowd were crying hysterically I kept pushing and pulling my way 
toward the southwest side exit that the Secret Service had used to bring the President in. 

The escape route had been established beforehand. 

Beyond the glowing red EXIT sign, a long concrete tunnel led to a special visitors' 
parking area on the river side of the building. 

Bulletproof, armor-plated cars were waiting there. What else might be waiting? I 
wondered. A voice in my head shouted for attention as I moved forward as fast as I 


could. Jack and Jill have always been a step ahead of us. They missed him Why did they 
miss ? 

They don't make mistakes. 
I was less than a dozen yards from the President and his Secret Service guards when it hit 
me, when finally I understood what no one else did yet. 


"Change the route out!" I yelled at the top of my voice. "Change the escape route!" 


NO ONE heard me shouting. I could barely hear my own voice in the melee. There was 
too much noise and confusion inside Madison Square Garden. 
I pushed ahead anyway, desperately following the phalanx that looked like the rabble at a 


prizefight from my vantage point. 
The smoke from the bomb had created a kind of strobe-light effect. 
"Change the escape route! Change the escape route!" I shouted over and over. 
We finally entered the whitewashed concrete tunnel. Every sound echoed bizarrely off 


the walls. I was right behind the last of the Secret Service agents. 
"Don't go this way! Stop the President!" I continued to.yell in vain. 
The tunnel was full of late-arriving special guests and even more security guards. We 


were pushing forward against a strong tide coming the other way It was too late to change 
the route now. I pushed and shoved my way closer and closer to President and Mrs. 
Byrnes. I desperately searched the crowd for the face of Kevin Hawkins. There was still 
a chance to stop him. 

Every face I encountered registered shock. The eyes I saw were wide with fear, and they 
were searching my face. Suddenly, there were several loud pops in the heart of the 
tunnel. Gunshots! 

Five shots seemed to explode inside the tight phalanx of people around the President. 
Someone had gotten inside the defense perimeter. My body sagged as if I'd been shot 
myself. 

Five shots. Three quick -- then two more. 

I couldn't see what had happened up ahead, but suddenly I heard the eeriest sound. It was 
a high-pitched wall, a keening. 
Five shots! 



Three -- then two more. 


The keening sound was coming from where I had last seen fleeting glimpses of President 
Byrnes, where the shots had exploded just a few seconds before. 
I shoved my body, all my weight, against the crowd and forced myself toward the 


epicenter of the madness. 


It felt as if I were trying to swim out of quicksand, to pull myself free. It was almost 
impossible to walk, to push, to shove. 
Five shots. What had happened up ahead? 
Then I could see. I saw everything at once. 
My mouth felt incredibly dry. My eyes were watering. The bunkerlike tunnel had 


become strangely quiet. President Thomas Byrnes was down on the gray cement floor. 
A lot of blood was flowing in rivulets, spreading down his white shirt. Bright red blood 
drained from the right side of his face, or maybe the wound was high in his neck. I 
couldn't tell from where I was. 

Gunshots. Execution-style. 
A professional hit. 
Jack and Jill, those bastards! 
It was their pattern, or close to it. 
I waded forward, roughly, shoving people out of my way, I saw Don Hamerman, Jay 


Grayer, and then Sally Byrnes. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion. 
Sally Byrnes was trying to get to her husband. The First Lady didn't appear to be hurt. 
Still, I wondered if she was a target, too. Maybe Jill's target? Secret Service agents were 


holding Mrs. Byrnes back, trying to protect her. They wanted to keep her away from the 
bloodshed, from her husband, from any possible danger. 
I saw a second body then. The shock was like a low hard punch to my stomach. No one 


could have anticipated this terrible scene. 


A woman was down near the President. She'd been shot in her right eye socket. There 
was a second wound in her throat. 
She appeared to be dead. A semiautomatic lay near her sprawled body. 
The assassin ? 



Jill? 

Who else could it possibly be? 

My eyes were drawn back to the motionless figure of Thomas Byrnes. I was afraid that 
he was already dead. I couldn't be sure, but I believed he'd been hit at least three times. I 
saw Sally Byrnes finally reach her husband's body. She was weeping uncontrollably, and 
she wasn't the only one. 

JACK SAT STILL and calmly watched the maze of bumper-to-bumper cars and tractor-
trailers stalled on West Street near the entrance to New York's Holland Tunnel. 

He could hear radios blaring on each side of his black Jeep. 

He observed the troubled and confused faces inside the cars. 

A middle-aged woman in a forest-green Lexus was in tears. A thousand sirens screamed 
like banshees on the loose in midtown. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill. Now everyone knew why, or at least they thought they 
did. 

Now everyone understood the seriousness of the game. 

Turn off your news reports, he wanted to tell all these well-meaning people approaching 
the tunnel out of New York. What's happened has nothing to do with any of you. It 
really and truly doesn't. You'll never know the truth. No one ever will. You can't handle 
the truth, anyway. You wouldn't understand if I stopped and explained it to you right 
here. 

He tried not to think about Sara Rosen as he finally rode into the long, claustrophobic 
tunnel that snaked beneath the Hudson. 

Beyond the tunnel, he drove south on the New Jersey Turnpike, then on 1-95 into 
Delaware and points farther south. 

Sara was the past, and the past didn't matter. The past didn't exist, except as a lesson for 
the future. Sara was gone. He did think about poor Sara as he ate at the Country 
Cupboard near the Talleyville exit on the turnpike. It was important to grieve. 

For Jill, not for President Byrnes. She was worth a dozen Thomas Byrneses. She had 
done a good job, a nearly perfect job, even if she had been used right from the start. And 
Sara Rosen had definitely been used. She had been his eyes and ears inside the White 
House. She had been his mistress. Poor Monkey Face. 


As he approached Washington about seven that night, he made a vow: he wouldn't 
sentimentalize about Sara again. He knew he could do that. He could control his own 
thoughts. 

He was better than Kevin Hawkins, who had been a very good soldier indeed. 
He had been Jack. 
But he was no longer Jack. 
Jack no longer existed. 
He was no longer Sam Harrison, either. Sam Harrison had been a facade, a necessary 


safeguard, a part of the complex plan. Sam Harrison no longer existed. 
Now his life could be simple and mostly good again. He was almost home. He had 
completed his Mission: Impossible, and it was a success. Everything had gone almost 


perfectly Then he was home, pulling into the familiar rounded driveway that was filled 
with colorful seashells and tiny pebbles and a few children's toys. 
He saw his little girl come running out of the house, her blond hair streaming. He saw his 


wife close behind her, also running. 


Tears rolled down her cheeks and down his own. He wasn't afraid to cry. He wasn't 
afraid of anything anymore. 
Jesus God, mercy, the war was finally ended. The enemy, the evil one, was dead. The 


good guys had won, and the most precious way of life on earth was safe for a little while 
longer--for the lives of his children, anyway. 
No one would ever know how and why it had happened, or who was really responsible. 
Just as it had been with JFK in Dallas. 


And RFK in Los Angeles. 
And Watergate and Whitewater and most every other significant event in our recent 
history. In truth, our history was not knowing; it was being carefully shielded from the 
truth. That was the American way 


"I love you so much," his wife whispered breathlessly against the side of his face. "You 
are my hero. You did such a good, brave thing." 
He believed it, too. He knew it deep within his heart. 
He wasn't Jack anymore. Jack no longer existed. 



IT WASN'T OVER! 

At a little past noon, the Secret Service received news from the NYPD of another 
homicide. They had strong reason to believe it was related to the shooting of President 
Byrnes. 

Jay Grayer and I rushed to the Peninsula Hotel, which is just off Fifth Avenue in 
midtown. We were completely numb from the horror of the morning and still couldn't 
believe the President had been shot. Even so, we had all the details of the latest murder. 

A chambermaid at the hotel had discovered a body in a suite on the twelfth floor. There 
was also a poem from Jack and Jill in the room. A final poem? 

"What is the NYPD saying?" I asked Jay during the ride uptown. "What are the details?" 

"According to the initial report, the dead woman might be Jill. Jill could have been 
murdered -- or maybe she committed suicide. They're reasonably certain the note is 
authentic." 

The mysteries inside horrific mysteries continued. Was this death part of the Jack and Jill 
scheme, too? I thought that probably it was, and that there were even more layers to 
unravel -- layers upon layers -- before getting to the core of the horror. 

Grayer and I emerged from a gold-plated elevator onto the crime-scene floor. New York 
police were everywhere. I saw emergency medics, SWAT team members in helmets 
with Plexiglas face masks, uniforms, homicide detectives. The scene was instant bedlam. 
I was worried about evidence contamination, leaks to the press. 

"The President?" one of the New York detectives asked us as we arrived. "Any word? 
Any hope?" 

"He's still hanging in there. Sure; there's hope," Jay Grayer said; then we moved on, 
away from the cluster of detectives. 

At least a dozen New York police and FBI agents were crowded into the hotel suite. The 
ominous sounds of police sirens rose from the streets below. Church bells pealed loudly, 
probably at nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral, just south on Fifth Avenue. 

A blond woman's body lay on the plush gray carpet next to an unmade double bed. Her 
face, neck, and chest were covered with blood. She was wearing a silver-and-blue 
jogging suit. 

A pair of wire-rim eyeglasses were on the rug near her Nike sneakers. 

She had been shot execution-style -- as the early victims of Jack and Jill had been. 


One shot, close to the head. 

Very professional. Very cold. 

No passion. 

"Was she ever on any of our suspect lists?" I asked Grayer. We knew that the dead 
woman's name was Sara Rosen. She had been cleared as part of the White House staff. 
She'd escaped detection during two "thorough" investigations of the staff, and that was 
the scariest piece of evidence yet. 

"Not that we know of. She was something of a fixture at the White House 
communications office. Everybody liked her efficiency, her professionalism. She was 
trusted. Jesus, what a mess. 

What a disaster. She was trusted, Alex." 

Part of the left side of her face was gone, ripped away as if by an animal. Jill looked as if 
she had been caught by surprise. Her eyebrows were arched. There was no fear in her 
eyes. 

She had trusted her killer. Was it Jack who had pulled the trigger? 

I noticed the smudging around the wound, the gray ring. It was a close-range discharge. 
It must have been Jack. Professional. 

No passion. Another execution. 

But is this really Jill? I wondered as I bent over the body The contract killer Kevin 
Hawkins had died at St. Vincent's Hospital downtown. We knew that Hawkins had 
disguised himself as a female FBI agent to get into Madison Square Garden. He had used 
the concussion bomb to get his target where he wanted, when he wanted. He'd been 
waiting in the exit tunnel, dressed as a woman. It had worked. What was Kevin 
Hawkins's relationship to this woman? What in hell was going on? 

"He left a poem. Somebody did. Looks like the others," Jay Grayer said to me. The note 
was in a plastic evidence bag. He handed it to me. "The last will and testament of Jack 
and Jill," he said. 

"The perfect assassination," I muttered, more to myself than to Grayer. "Jack and Jill both 
dead in New York. Case closed, right?" 

The Secret Service agent stared at me and then slowly shook his head. "This case will 
never be closed. Not in our lifetime, anyway" 


"I was just being ironic," I said. 

I read the final note. 

Jack and Jill came to The Hill Where Jill did what she must. 

Her reason drove her The game is over Though dead Jill's cause was just. 

"Fuck you Jill," I whispered over the dead body "I hope you burn in hell for what you've 
done today I hope there's a hell just for you and Jack." 

NOWHERE was the news of the shooting taken any harder than in Washington. Thomas 
Byrnes was loved and he was hated, but he was one of the city's own, especially now. 

Christine Johnson was in shock, as were her closest friends and most everyone that she 
knew. The teachers at Sojourner Truth and the children were completely destroyed by 
what had happened to the President in New York City. It was so horrifying and stark, but 
also so unbearably sad and unreal. 

Because of the shooting, all D.C. schools had canceled classes for the afternoon. She 
had been watching the nightmarish TV coverage of the assassination attempt from the 
first moment she got home from school. She still couldn't believe what had happened. 

No one could believe it. The President was still alive. No other bulletins were being 
released. 

Christine didn't know whether Alex Cross had been at Madison Square Garden, but she 
imagined that he had been there. She worried about Alex, too. She liked the detective's 
sincerity and his tuner strength, but especially his compassion and his vulnerability She 
liked the way he looked, talked, acted. She also liked the way Alex was bringing up his 
son, Damon. It made her want children even more herself. She and George had to talk 
about that. She and George had to talk. 

He arrived home before seven that night, which was an hour or two early for him. 
George Johnson was a hard worker in his corporate law job. He was thirty-seven years 
old and had a smooth, attractive baby face. He was a good man, although way too self-
centered and, truthfully, a little bit of a buppie at times. 

Christine loved him, though; she accepted the good and the bad. She was thinking that as 
she fiercely hugged him at the front door. There was no doubt of it in her mind. She and 
George had met at Howard University and been together ever since. That was the way 
she believed it ought to be, and would be as far as she was concerned. 

"People are still out there crying in the streets," George said. 


After the hug, he shucked off his wool Brooks Brothers suit jacket and loosened his tie, 
but he didn't go upstairs to change. He was breaking all his usual patterns tonight. Well, 
good for George. 

"I didn't vote for President Byrnes, but this has really gotten to me anyway, Chris. What 
a damn shame." There were tears in his eyes, and that started her up again, too. 

George usually kept his feelings to himself, everything all bottled up. Christine was 
touched by her husband's emotion. 

She was touched a great deal. 

"I've cried a couple of times," she confided to George. "You know me. I did vote for the 
President, but that's not it. It just seems as though we're losing respect for every 
institution, everything permanent. We're losing respect for human life at a very fast rate. 
I even see it in the eyes of six-year-old schoolchildren. 

I see it every day at the Truth School." 

George Johnson held his wife again, held her tight. At five eleven, he was exactly her 
height. Christine rested her head softly against the side of his. She smelled of light citrus 
fragrance. She'd worn it to school. He loved her so much. She was like no other 
woman, no other person he'd ever met. He felt incredibly lucky to have her, to be loved 
by her, to hold her like this. 

"Do you know what I'm saying?" she asked, wanting to talk with George tonight, not 
willing to let him disappear on her, as he so often did. 

"Sure I do," he said. "Everybody feels it, Chrissie. Nobody knows how to begin to make 
it stop, though." 

"I'll fix us something to eat. We can watch the dregs on CNN," she finally said. "Part of 
me doesn't want to watch the news, but part of me has to watch this." 

"I'll help with the grub," George offered, which was rare. She wished that he could be 
like this more often and that it didn't take a national tragedy to get him in touch with his 
emotions. Well, a lot of men were like that, she knew. There were worse things in a 
marriage. 

They made a vegetarian gumbo together and opened a bottle of Chardonnay. They had 
barely finished supper in front of the TV when the front doorbell rang. It was a little 
before nine, and they weren't expecting anyone, but sometimes neighbors dropped in. 

CNN was covering the scene at New York University Hospital, where the President had 
been rushed after the shooting. 


Alex Cross had appeared with various other officers who had been at the scene of the 
shooting, but he wouldn't say much to the media. Alex looked upset, spent, but also, 
well-noble. 

Christine didn't mention to George that she knew him. 

She wondered why. She hadn't told George about Alex's visit to their house late one 
night. He had slept right through it; but that was George. 

Before he could get up off the couch, the doorbell rang a second time. Then, a third ring. 
Whoever it was wouldn't go away. 

"I'll get it, Chrissie," he said. "Don't know who in hell that could be, this time of night. 
Do you?" 

"I don't, either." 

"All right, already," he snapped. Christine found herself smiling. 

George the Impatient was back. 

"I'm coming for Christmas' sake. I'm coming, I'm coming. 

Hold your water, I'm coming," he said as he hobbled toward the door in his stockinged 
feet. 

He peered through the peephole, then turned to look at Christine with a questioning scowl 
on his face. 

"It's some white kid." 

DANNY BOUDREAUX stood on the shiny, white-painted porch of the schoolteacher's 
house. He was dressed in an oversized army-green rain poncho that made him look 
bigger than he actually was, somewhat more impressive. The Sojourner Truth School 
killer in the flesh! He was in his glory now. But even in his megahyper mood, he sensed 
that something was wrong with him now. 

He didn't feel good, and he was getting sad- kind of depressed as hell, actually. The 
machine was breaking down. The doctors couldn't figure whether he was a bipolar 
disorder or conduct disorder. If they couldn't, how the hell was he supposed to? 

So what if he was a little impulsive, had huge mood swings, was a social misfit? The 
fuse was litHe was ready to blow. kike, who cared? 


He had stopped his dosages ofDepakote. Just say no, right? He was humming the 
"Mmm mm mm" song over and over. Crash Test Dummies. Sad, angry music that just 
wouldn't stop playing in his head like MTV Muzak. 

His "mad button" seemed to be stuck -- permanently. 

He was mad at Jack and Jill. Real mad at Alex Cross. Mad at the principal of the Truth 
School. Mad at just about everybody on the planet. He was even mad at himself now. 
He was such a goddamn screwup. Always had been, always would be. 

I'm a loser, baby. 

So why don't you kill me? 

He snapped back to semireality when a black fucker wearing a blue pinstriped shirt, suit 
trousers, and mellow-yellow suspenders answered the door. Hey, welcome to the 
Cyburbs! 

At first, Danny Boudreaux didn't understand who the hell the round-faced black dude 
was. He'd been expecting the big-deal school principal Mrs. Johnson, or maybe even 
Alex Cross, if Cross hadn't gone to New York. He had seen Cross and the principal 
together on three different occasions. He guessed they were getting it on. 

He didn't know why that made him mad, but it did. Cross was just like his goddamn 
father, his real father. Another fuck-up cop who had deserted him, who didn't think he 
was worth dogshit. 

And now Cross was humping this teacher on the side. 

Wait, wait, hold on, Danny Boudreaux suddenly got something clear. A flash. This self-
righteous Kunta Kinte dude has to be her husband, right ? Of course he was. 

"Yes? Can I help you with something?" George Johnson asked the strange-looking and 
disheveled young man on the porch. 

He didn't know the paper-delivery boy in the neighborhood, but maybe this was he. For 
some strange reason, the white boy reminded him of a disturbing movie called Kids that 
he'd watched with Christine. The boy looked as if he had some trouble in his life right 
now. 

In Danny Boudreaux's humble opinion, the black guy seemed real unfriendly and uppity 
as hell. Especially for the nobody husband of some nobody schoolteacher. That pissed 
him off even more. Made him see about twelve different shades of red. Put him over the 
edge. 


He felt one of the worst rages coming on. Hurricane Daniel was about to strike in 
Mitchellville. 

"Noooooo!" he nearly yelled at the man. "You can't even help yourself. You sure as shit 
can't help me!" 

Danny Boudreaux suddenly yanked out his semiautomatic. 

George Johnson looked at the gun in disbelief. He stepped back quickly from the door. 
He threw up both his arms in self-defense. 

"Without any hesitation, Boudreaux fired twice. "Take that, you silly black rabbit!" he 
yelled, letting the voices come as they may The two bullets hit George Johnson 4n the 
chest. 

He flew back through the open door as if he'd been struck with a sledgehammer. He 
bounced once off the cream marble floor. 

The cat was DOA for sure. Blood was surging from the two holes in his chest. 

The Sojourner Truth School killer then walked right into the teacher's house. He stepped 
over the fallen body as if it were worth nothing. He was feeling nothing. 

"I'll just go ahead in, thanks," he said to the dead man on the floor. "You've been most 
helpful." 

Christine Johnson had risen from the couch in the living room when she heard the shots. 
He had forgotten how goddamn tall she was. Danny Boudreaux could see her from the 
front hallway She could see him and her husband's body as well. 

She didn't look so almighty-in-charge anymore. He had knocked her ass down a peg real 
quick. She deserved it, too. She'd hurt his feelings the first time they met. She probably 
didn't even remember the incident. 

"Remember me?" he called to her. "Remember hassling me, bitch? At the Truth School? 
You remember me, don't you?" 

"Oh, my God. Oh, George. Oh, God, George," she moaned the words. A dry sob was 
shaking her body She looked as if she might collapse. He saw that fucking Jack and Jill 
was on the tube. 

Goddamnit. They were always trying to one-up him. Even here, even now Danny 
Boudreaux could tell that the schoolteacher wanted to run real bad. There was nowhere 
to go, though. Not unless she went right through the picture window and out onto her 
lawn. 


She had her hand up to her mouth. Her hand looked as if it were stuck there with Velcro. 
Probably in shock. 

"Don't yell anymore," he warned her in a high-pitched scream of his own. "Don't scream 
again or I'll shoot you, too. I can and I will. I'll shoot you dead as the doorman." 

He closed in on her now. He kept the Smith & Wesson pointed out in front of him. He 
wanted her to see that he was very comfortable with the weapon, very expert with 
firearms -- which he was, thanks to the Teddy Roosevelt School His hand was shaking 
some, but so what? He wouldn't miss her at this distance. 

"Hi there, Mrs. Johnson," he said and gave her his best spooky-guy grin. "I'm the one 
who killed Shanelie Green and Vernon Wheatley. Everybody's been looking all over for 
me. 

Well, I guess you found me," he told her. "Congratulations, babe. 

Nice work." 

Danny Boudreaux was crying now, and he couldn't remember why he was so sad. All he 
knew for sure was that he was furiously angry. With everybody. Everybody had fucked 
up real bad this time. This was about the worst so far. 

No happy, happy. No joy, joy. 

"I'm the Truth School killer," he repeated. "You believe that? 

You got it? It's a true tale. Tale of heartbreak and woe. Don't you even remember me? 
Am I that forgettable? I sure remember you." 

I RUSHED BACK to the Washington, D.C., area that night about eleven o'clock. The 
Sojourner Truth School killer was rampaging. I had predicted he was going to go off, but 
being right held no rewards for me. Stopping the explosion might. 

Maybe it was no accident that he was blowing the same night as Jack and Jill. He wanted 
to be better than them, didn't he? He wanted to be important, famous, in the brightest 
spotlight. He couldn't bear being Nobody. 

I tried to put my mind somewhere else for the short time I was on the military jet. I was 
feeling so low, I could have jumped off a dime. I scanned the late papers, which carried 
front-page stories about President Byrnes and the shooting in New York. The President 
was in extremely critical condition at New York University Hospital on East Thirty-third 
Street in Manhattan. Jack and Jill were both reported dead. Doctors at University 
Hospital didn't know if the President would survive the night. 


I was numb, disoriented, overloaded, on the slippery borderline of shock trauma myself. 
Now it was getting worse. I didn't know for certain if I could handle this, but I hadn't 
been given a choice. 

The killer had demanded to see me. He claimed that I was his detective and that he'd 
been calling my house for the past few days. 

A police cruiser was scheduled to meet me at Andrews Air Force Base. From there I'd be 
taken to nearby Mitchellville, where Danny Boudreaux was holding Christine Johnson 
hostage. So far, Boudreaux had murdered two small children, a classmate of his named 
Sumner Moore, and his own foster parents. It was an extraordinary rampage, and the 
case deserved more resources than it had received from the Metro police. 

A police cruiser was waiting at Andrews as promised. Somebody had put together 
material for me on Daniel Boudreaux. The boy had been under a psychiatrist's care since 
he was seven. He had been severely depressed. He'd apparently committed bizarre acts 
of animal torture as early as seven. Daniel Boudreaux's real mother had died during his 
infancy, and he blamed himself. His real father had committed suicide. The father had 
been a state trooper in Virginia. Another cop, I noted. Probably some kind of 
transference going on inside the boy's head. 

I recognized Summer Street as soon as we branched off the John Hanson Highway. A 
detective from Prince Georges County sat with me in the backseat of the cruiser. His 
name was Henry Fornier. He tried to brief me on the hostage situation as best he could 
under the bizarre circumstances. 

"As we understand it, Dr. Cross, George Johnson has been shot, and he may be dead in 
the house. The boy won't allow the body to be removed or to receive any medical 
attention," Officer Fornier told me. "He's a nasty bastard, I'll tell you. A real little prick." 

"Boudreaux was being treated for his anger, his depression and rage cycles, with 
Depakote. I'll bet anything that he's off it now," I said. I was thinking out loud, trying to 
prepare myself for whatever was coming just a few blocks up this peaceful-looking street. 

It didn't matter that the Boudreaux boy was thirteen years old. He had already killed five 
times. That's what he did: he killed. 

Another monster. A very young, horrifying monster. 

I spotted Sampson, who was half a head taller than the other policemen stationed outside 
the Johnson house. I tried to take in everything. There were scores of police, but also 
soldiers in riot gear with military camouflage at the scene. Cars and trucks with 
government license plates were parked all over the street. 


I walked right over to Sampson. He knew the things I needed to hear, and he would 
know how to-talk to me. "Hey there, Sugar," he greeted me with a hint of his usual ironic 
smile. "Glad you could make it to the party." 

"Yeah, nice to see you, too," I said. 

"Friend of yours wants to see you. Wants to talk the talk with Dr. Cross. You've got the 
damnedest friends." 

"Yeah. I sure do," I said to Sampson. He was one of them. 

"They're holding back firepower because he's a kid? Is that what's going on so far?" 

Sampson nodded. I had it right. "He's just another stone killer, Alex," he said. "You 
remember that. He's just another killer." 

A THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD MURDERER. 

I began to pay very close attention to the staging area that had been set up around the 
perimeter of the Johnson house. Even relatively small, local police forces were getting 
good at this sort of thing. Terror was invading towns with names like Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, and now, Mitchellville. 

A late-model, dark blue van with its back doors open held TV monitors, state-of-the-art 
sound equipment, phones, a desktop workstation. A techie was crouched near a 
windblown willow tree listening to the house with a microphone gun. The gun could 
pick up voices from well over a hundred yards. 

Surveillance shots and also assorted photos of the boy were tacked to a board propped 
against a squad car. A helicopter was spraying high-intensity beams on the rooftops and 
trees. Here the hostage drama was unfolding as we know and love it. 

In suburbia this time. 

A thirteen-year-old boy named Daniel Boudreaux. 

Just another stone killer. 

"Who do they have talking to him?" I asked Sampson as we wandered closer to the 
house. I spotted a black Lexus parked in the driveway George Johnson's car? "Who's the 
negotiator on this?" 

"They got Paul Losi down here as soon as they found out about the hostage situation, and 
how goddamn bad it was." 

I nodded and felt a little relief at the choice of a negotiator. 


"That's good. Losi is tough. He's good under pressure, too. How is the boy 
communicating from the house?" 

"At first, over the phone lines. Then he demanded a megaphone. 

Threw a real tantrum. Threatened to shoot the teacher and himself on the spot. So the 
bad boy got his own blowhorn. 

He uses that now. He and Paul Losi are not exactly what you call 'hitting it off."" 

"How about Christine Johnson? She still okay? What do you hear?" 

"Appears to be all right, so far. She's been cool under fire. We think she's holding the 
bad boy in control somehow, but just barely She's tough." 

That much I knew already She's even tougher than you are, Daddy. I hoped Damon was 
one hundred percent right. I hoped she was tougher than all of us. 

George Pittman wandered up beside Sampson and me while we were talking. The chief 
of detectives was the last person I wanted to see then, absolutely the last. I still suspected 
he was the one who had "volunteered" me to the White House. I swallowed any anger I 
was feeling; swallowed my pride, too. 

"FBI has sharpshooters in place," Pittman informed us. 

"Trouble is, the powers won't let us use them. The little bastard's been out in the open a 
couple of times." 

I stayed even and calm with Pittman. He still had a gun to my head. We both knew it. 
"Trouble is, the killer is thirteen years old. 

He's probably suicidal," I said. I was making an educated guess, but I was almost certain 
it was the right one. He had cornered himself in the Johnson house, then started 
screaming come and get me. 

Pittman's face became a dark scowl. His face was tinged with red down to his bull neck. 
"He thinks the five murders he's committed are funny Little fucker told the negotiator that 
already He laughs about the murders. He's asking for you specifically Now how do you 
feel about the sharpshooters?" Pittman came back at me before he walked away. 

Sampson shook his head. "Don't even think about going in there to play games with 
Dennis the Menace," he said. 


"I need to understand him better. I have to talk to him to do that," I muttered and looked 
at the Johnson house. There were plenty of lights on downstairs. None up on the second 
floor. 

"You understand him too goddamn much already, though you'd deny it. You understand 
so much about the crazies, you're going over the edge yourself. You hear me? You 
understand that?" 

I did understand. I had a fair idea of my own strengths and weaknesses. Most of the time, 

anyway. Maybe not on a night like this one, though. 
A voice on a megaphone interrupted us. The Sojourner Truth School killer had decided 
to speak. 


"Hey! Hey, out there! Hey, you dumb bastards! Did you forget something? Remember 


me?" 
I got to hear Danny Boudreaux for the first time. He sounded like a boy. Nasal, high-
pitched, ordinary as hell. Thirteen years old. 


"You sons of bitches are screwing with my head, aren't you?" 


he screeched. "I'll answer my ownquestion. Yeah, you are! You're fucking with the 
wrong falcon." 
Paul Losi blew once on his bullhorn. "Hold on. That's really not the case, Danny. 


You've been in control all the way so far. You know that, Danny Let's be fair about this." 


"Bullshit!" Danny Boudreaux answered back angrily. "That's so much bullshit, it makes 
me sick to the gills just to hear it. 
You make me sick, Losi. You also make me super pissed-off, you know that, Losi?" 
"Tell me what the problem is." The negotiator maintained a cool head under fire. "Talk 


to me, Danny. I want to talk to you. 
I know you might not believe that, but I do." 
"I know you do, asshole. It's your job to keep me on the line. 
Trouble is, you cheated, you lied, you said you loved me. You lied! So nowyou're off 


my team. Not one more word from you, or I'll murder Mrs. Johnson. It'll be your fault. 
"I'll kill her now. I swear to God, I will. Even though she was nice enough to make me a 
fried egg sandwich before. BANG!... 


BANG!... SHE'S DEAD!" 

The police were everywhere outside the Johnson house. They began to lower their dark 
Plexiglas face masks. Riot shields were slowly raised. The forces were getting ready to 
rush the house. If they did, Christine Johnson would very likely die. 

"What is your problem?" the negotiator cautiously asked the boy "Talk to me. We'll 
work it out, Danny. We can come to a solution that works for you. What's the problem?" 

For a while it was eerily quiet on the front lawn and on the street. I could hear the wind 
rush through willow and evergreen trees. 

Then Danny Boudreaux screamed out. 

"What's my problem? What's my problem? You're such aphony asshole, is part of my 
problem.... The other part is that the man is here. Alex Cross is here, and you didn't tell 
me. I had to find out on the TV news] 

"You have exactly thirty seconds, Detective Cross. Make that twenty-nine. Twenty-
eight. I can't wait to meet you, sucker. I can't wait for this. Twenty-seven. Twenty-six. 
Twenty-five..." 

The Sojourner Truth School killer was calling the shots. A thirteen-year-old boy A 
command performance. 

"THIS IS ALEX CROSS," I called out to the teenage murderer. I was standing on the 
outer edge of the Johnson's frostbitten lawn. 

I didn't need a megaphone for Danny Boudreaux to hear me. Your detective is here. 
Everything is going just the way you want it to go. 

"This is Detective Cross," I called out again. "You're right, I'm here. I just arrived, 
though. I came because you asked for me. 

We're taking this seriously Nobody's messing around with you. 

Nobody would do that." 

Not yet, anyway, Give me half a chance, though, and I'll mess with you good. I 
remembered poor little Shanelle Green. I remembered seven-year-old Vernon Wheatley, 
I thought about Christine Johnson trapped inside with the young killer who had shot her 
husband before her eyes. I wanted the chance to mess with Daniel Boudreaux. 

Boudreaux suddenly laughed into his megaphone -- a high-pitched girlish giggle. 
Spooky as hell. A few people in the crowd of onlookers and ambulance-chasers laughed 
along with the boy, Nice to know you have friends out there. 


"Well, it's about time, Detective Alex Cross. It's so nice that you can fit me into your 
busy schedule. Mrs. Johnson thinks so, too. 

We're here waiting, waiting, waiting for you... so c'mon in the house. Let's have a party" 

The boy was openly challenging me and my authority, He needed to be the one in charge. 
I was charting everything in my head, keeping track of his every move, but also the 
sequence. 

Paranoid schizophrenic was a possible diagnosis. Bipolar or conduct disorder was a 
better guess. I needed to talk to him to find out the rest. 

Danny Boudreaux seemed coherent, anyway, He appeared to be following actions in real 
time. I wondered if he might be taking his Depakote again. 

A voice close behind me said, "Alex, come over here, goddammit. I want to talk to you. 
Alex, come here." 

I turned around and faced the music. Sampson was scowling from ear to ear. "We don't 
need another hostage in there," he said in no uncertain terms. He was angry with me 
already His eyes were dark beads, his brow deeply furrowed. "You didn't hear him 
raving before, through most of last night. The bad boy is real crazy, The boy is crazy as 
shit, Alex. All he wants to do is kill somebody else." 

"I think I'll be all right with him," I said. "He's my type of boy, Gary Soneji, Casanova, 
Danny Boudreaux. Besides, I don't have a choice." 

"You have a choice, Sugar. You just don't have any good sense." 

I looked back at the house. Christine Johnson was in there with the killer. If I didn't go 
in, he'd kill her. He'd said so, and I believed him. What choice did that leave me? 
Besides, no good deed goes unpunished, right? 

Chief Pittman signaled that I had the go-ahead from him. It was up to me. Doctor-
Detective Cross. 

I sucked in a deep breath and began to walk across the wet, springy front lawn to the 
house. The news photographers took a flurry of flashshots in the few seconds it took me 
to move to the front door. Suddenly, all the TV cameras were aimed at me. 

I was definitely concerned about Danny Boudreaux. He was incredibly dangerous right 
now. He'd been on a killing spree. 

Five indiscriminate murders within the last few weeks. Now he was cornered. Even 
worse, he had cornered himself. 


My hand reached out for the front doorknob. I was feeling numb and a little out of it. 
My vision was tunneled. I focused on the whitewashed door and nothing else. 

"It's open." A voice came from behind the door. 

A boy's voice. A little raspy. Small and fragile without the megaphone to amplify it. 

I pushed open the front door and finally saw the Truth School killer in all of his insane 
glory. 

Danny Boudreaux wasn't much more than five three or four. 

He had thin, squinty eyes like a rodent's, large ears, a bad buzz haircut. He was an odd-
looking boy, clearly an outcast, a freak. 

I sensed that other kids wouldn't like him much, that he was a loner, and had been for all 
of his life. 

He had a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic aimed chest-high at me. 

"Military school," he reminded me. "I'm an expert marksman, Detective Cross. I have 
no difficulty with human targets." 

MY HEART was clanging around inside the tight metal cage that was supposed to be my 
chest. The loud buzzing sound in my head was still there, like irritating static on a radio. 
I didn't feel much like a police hero. I felt scared. It was worse than usual. Maybe 
because the killer was thirteen years old. 

Danny Boudreaux knew how to use the semiautomatic clenched in his hand, and sooner 
or later, he would. The only thing in the universe that mattered to me right then was to 
get that Smith & Wesson away from him. 

The image before me commanded all my attention: a thin, pimply thirteen-year-old boy 
with a powerful, deadly handgun. 

A semiautomatic was pointed at my heart. Although Boudreaux's hand was steady 
enough, he appeared to be more mentally and physically out of it than I had thought. He 
was probably decompensating. His behavior was likely to become increasingly more 
bizarre. His instability was obvious and scary to confront. 

It was in his eyes. His eyes darted about like birds caught in a glass bubble. 

He was weaving slightly as he stood in the foyer of the Johnson house. He waved the gun 
in small circles at me. He was wearing a strange sweatshirt with the printed message 
HAppy, HAPPY. JOY, JOY. 


His short hair was dripping wet with perspiration. His glasses were slightly fogged 
around the edges. Behind the glasses, his eyes were glazed and shiny-wet. He looked the 
part of the Truth School killer. I doubted that anyone had ever liked Danny Boudreaux 
too much. I didn't. 

His wiry body suddenly snapped rigidly to attention. "Welcome on board, Detective 
Cross, sir!" 

"Hello, Danny," I spoke to him in as low-key and nonthreatening a way as I could. "You 
called, and now I'm here." I'm the one who is going to take your ass down. 

He kept his distance. He was a jangle of raw nerves and incredible, pent-up anger. He 
was a puppet without a puppeteer. 

There was no way to predict how this was going to go from here. 

He was almost definitely suffering a withdrawal from his prescription drugs. Danny 
Boudreaux had the whole package of symptoms: aggression, depression, psychosis, 
hyperactivity, behavioral deterioration. 

A thirteen-year-old, stone-cold killer. How do I get the gun away from him? 

Christine Johnson was standing in the darkened living room behind him. She didn't move. 
She looked very distant in the background and small, in spite of her height. She looked 
frightened, sad, tired. 

To her right was an exquisitely carved fireplace that looked as if it had been scavenged 
from some big-city brownstone. I hadn't seen much of the living room before. I studied 
it closely now. I was looking for some kind of weapon. Anything to help us. 

George Johnson lay on the off-white marble floor in the foyer. 

Christine or the boy had placed a red plaid blanket over the body The slain lawyer looked 
as if he'd lain down to take a nap. 

"Christine, are you okay?" I called across the room. She started to speak, then stopped 
herself. 

"She's fine, man. She's mighty fine pudding. She's all right," 

Boudreaux snapped at me. He slurred his words, so that they sounded like "cheese alriii." 

"She's a-okay, all right. I'm the one who's losing it here. This is about me." 


"I can understand how tired you are, Danny," I said to him. 


I suspected that he would be experiencing dizziness, impaired concentration, 
cottonmouth. 
"Yeah. You got that right. What else do you have to say for yourself? Any more nuggets 


of wisdom about my delusional behavior?" 
Wham! He suddenly kicked shut the front door behind us. 
More impulsive behavior. I had definitely joined the party. He was still very careful to 


keep his distance -- he kept the semi-automatic always pointed at me. 


"I can shoot this son of a bitch real well," he said,just in case I'd missed the point before. 
It reinforced my notion of his extreme paranoia, his agitation and nervousness. 
He was overly concerned about how I viewed him, how competent I judged him to be. 


He had me confused with his real father. 
The policeman father who had deserted him and his mother. 
I'd just learned about the connection on the ride over, but it made sense. It tracked 


perfectly, actually I reminded myself that this nervous, skinny, pathetic boy was a 
murderer. It wasn't hard for me to hate such a fiend. Still, there was also something 
tragically sad about the boy There was something so lonely and freakish about Daniel 
Boudreaux. 

"I believe that you can shoot extremely well," I told him quietly I knew it was what he 
wanted to hear. 

I believe you. 
I believe you are a stone-cold killer. I believe you are a young monster, and probably 
unredeemable. 


How do I get your gun? 
I believe I may have to kill you before you kill me or Christine Johnson. 
I LOOKED at the words Happy, Happy. JOY, JOY. I knew exactly where the saying on 


his sweatshirt came from. 


Nickelodeon. Childrenk TV. Damon and Jannie loved it. In a way, so did I. 
Nickelodeon was about families, and it probably infuriated Danny Boudreaux. 
He grinned at me! He had such a fiendish, madhouse look. 


Then he spoke quietly, as I just had. He expertly mimicked my concern for him. His 
instincts were sharp and cruel. It scared me again. It also made me want to rush him and 
punch his lights out. 

"You don't have to whisper. Nobody's sleeping in here. Well, nobody except George the 
Doorman." 

He laughed, reveling in his crazy, creepy inappropriateness. 
Here was the real psychopathic deal. Danny was a thrill killer in the flesh, even at 
thirteen. 


"Are you all right?" I asked Christine again. 
"No. Not really," she whispered. 
"Shut the hell up!" Boudreaux yelled at both of us. He pointed his gun at Christine, then 


back at me. "When I say something, I mean it." 


I realized I wasn't going to get the gun away from the boy. I had to try something else. 
He looked close to the breaking point, way too close. 
I decided to make a move immediately. 
I concentrated on the boy, trying to gauge his weaknesses. I watched him without 


seeming to watch. 
I took a couple of slow, deliberate steps toward the living room window. An ancient 
African milking stool sat there. I glanced outside at the police lines staggered across the 
front lawn, keeping their distance. I could see riot shields and Plexiglas masks, battle 

dress uniforms, flak vests, guns everywhere. Jesus, what a scene. This mad boy had 
caused all this. 
"Don't get any funny ideas," he told me from across the room. 
I already had afunny idea, Dannyboy. I already made my move. 
It done! Can you figure it out? Are you as smart as you think you are, creep? 
"Why not?" I asked him. He didn't answer me. He was going to kill us. What more 


could he do? 
There was a real good reason for me to be near the window. I was going to position 
myself and Christine Johnson on opposite sides of the living room. 



I'd done it. I had already made the move. 

Boudreaux didn't seem to notice. 

"What do you think of me now?" he snarled. "How do I stack up against those assholes 
Jack and Jill? How about against the great Gary Soneji? You can tell me the truth. Won't 
hurt my feelings. Because I don't have any feelings." 

"I'm going to tell you the truth," I said to him, "since that's what you want to hear. I 
haven't been impressed by any killers and I'm not impressed by you, either. Not in that 
way." 

His mouth twisted and he snarled, "Yeah? Well, I'm not impressed by you, either, Dr. 
Hotshit Cross. Who's got the gun, though?" 

Danny Boudreaux stared at me for a long, intense moment. 

His eyes looked crossed behind the lenses of his glasses. The pupils were pinpointed. He 
looked as if he were going to shoot me right then. My heart was racing. I looked across 
the room at Christine Johnson. 

"I have to kill you. You know that," he said as if it made all the sense in the world. 
Suddenly, he was speaking in a bored voice. It was disconcerting as hell. "You and 
Christine have to go down." 

He glanced around at her. His eyes were dark holes. "Black bitch! Sneaky, manipulative 
bitch, too. You dissed me bad at that stupid school of yours. How dare you disrespect 
me!" he flared again. 

"That's not true," Christine Johnson said. She spoke right up. "I was trying to protect 
those kids out in the yard. It had nothing to do with you. I had no idea who you were. 
How could I?" 

He stamped one black-booted foot hard. He was petulant, impatient, unforgiving. He 
was a mean little prick in every way, "Don't tell me what the hell I know! You can't tell 
what I'm thinking! You can't get inside my head! Nobody can." 

' "Why do you think you have to kill anybody else?" I asked Boudreaux. 

He flared at me again. Pointed his gun. "Don't fucking try to shrink-wrap me! Don't you 
dare." 

"I wouldn't do that." I shook my head. "Nobody likes lies, or people trying to pull cheap 
tricks. I don't." 

Suddenly, he swung the Smith & Wesson toward Christine. 


"I have to kill people because... that's what I do." He laughed again, cackled, and 


wheezed like a fiend. 
Christine Johnson sensed what was coming. She knew something had to be done before 
Danny Boudreaux exploded. 


The boy turned to me again. He swiveled his hips and almost seemed to be preening. He 


watching himself act like this, I realized. He's loving this. 
"You've been trying to trick me," he said. "That's why the calm Mr. Rogers voice. 
Backing off from me, so you're not so almighty big and threatening. I see right through 
you." 


"You're right," I said, "but not completely right. I've been talking like this... real softly... 
to distract you from what I'm really doing. You blew your own game. You just lost! 
You little chump. 

You weasly little son of a bitch." 
"YOU CAN'T SHOOT both of us," I told Danny Boudreaux. 
I spoke in a clear, firm voice. At the same time, I angled my body sideways. Gave him 


less of a target. 


I took another step toward my side of the large living room. I widened the distance 
between Christine Johnson and me. 
"What the hell do you mean? What are you talking about, Cross? TALK TO ME, 


CROSS! I DEMAND IT!" 
I didn't answer him. Let him figure it out. I knew that he would. 
He was a smart bad boy Daniel Boudreaux stared at me, then quickly back at Christine. 
He got the message. He finally saw the trap, subtle as it was. 
His eyes bore deeply into my skull. He knew what I'd done. 
One of us would get to him if he shot at the other. He couldn't have his final blaze of 


glory. 
"You dumb piece of shit," he growled at me. His voice was low and threatening. 
"You're the one who gets it first then!" 



He raised the Smith & Wesson. I was staring down the barrel at him. "TALK TO ME, 


YOU BASTARD!" 
"That's enough!" Christine shouted from the other side of the room. She was 
unbelievable under the pressure, the circumstances. 


"You've killed enough," she said to Boudreaux. 
Danny Boudreaux was starting to panic. Wild eyes stared out from a head that seemed to 


be on a swivel. "No, I haven't killed enough fucking useless robots. I'm just getting 
started!" His skin was stretched tight against the bones of his face. 
He swung the Smith & Wesson toward Christine. His arms were stretched ramrod 

straight. His whole body was shaking and canted to the left. 
"Danny? I yelled his name and started to move on him. 
He hesitated for an instant. Then he jerked the gun and fired. 
A deafening muzzle blast in close quarters. 
He fired at Christine! 
She tried to spin out of the way I couldn't tell if she had. 
I kept coming, then I was in the air. 
Danny Boudreaux swung the semiautomatic back at me. His eyes were filled with terror 


and intense hatred. His body shook with rage, fear, desperation. Maybe he could get us 


both. 
I moved a lot faster than he thought I could. I was inside the radius of his arm and the 
outstretched gun. 


I crashed into Danny Boudreaux as if he were a full-grown man, an armed and dangerous 


one. I crushed him with a full body-blow. I relished the contact. 
Danny Boudreaux and I were down in a sprawling heap. We were tangled up, a mass of 
flying arms and twitching, kicking legs. The revolver went off again. I didn't feel any 
blinding pain yet, but I tasted blood. 


The boy screamed in his high-pitched wall. He wailed! I wrenched the gun out of his 
hand. He tried to bite me, to rip into my flesh. Then the boy growled. 
He began to have a seizure, possibly from the drug withdrawal. 



A major surge of brain activity was being discharged in his body He was thrashing his 

arms and his legs. His pelvis thrust forward as if he were dry-humping my leg. 
His eyes rolled back, and his body suddenly went limp. Foam spewed from his mouth. 
His arms and legs continued to flail and twitch. He might have lost consciousness for a 
second or two. 

He continued to drool, to make choking and gurgling SOUnds. 
I flipped him on his side. His lips were dusky blue. His eyes finally rolled back into 


place. They started to blink rapidly. The seizure had ended as quickly as it had come. 
He lay limp on the floor, a pool of wild bad boy. 
The police had heard the shots. They were all over the living room. Riot shotguns, drawn 


pistols. Lots of shouting and squawking radio-receivers. Christine Johnson went to her 
husband. 

So did two of the EMS medics. 
The next time I looked, Christine was kneeling beside me. She didn't seem to be hurt. 
"Are you all right, Alex?" she asked in a hoarse whisper. 


I was still holding down Danny Boudreaux. He seemed unaware of his surroundings. He 
was streaming with cold, oily sweat. The Sojourner Truth School killer now looked sad, 
lost, and unbearably confused. Thirteen years old. Five homicides. 

Maybe more. 
"Grand mal?" Christine asked. 
I nodded. "I think so. Maybe just too much excitement." 
Danny Boudreaux was trying to say something, but I couldn't hear what it was. He 


sputtered, still drooling the bubbling white foam. 


"What did you say? What is it?" I asked. My voice was hoarse and my throat hurt. I 
was shaking and covered with sweat myself. 
He spoke in a tiny whisper, almost as if there were no one inside him anymore. "I'm 


afraid," he told me. "I don't know where I am. I'm always so afraid." 


I nodded at the small, horrifying face looking up at me. "I know," I said to the young 
killer. "I know what you're feeling." 
That was the scariest thing of all. 



THE DRAGONSLAYER lives, but how many lives do I have left? 

Why was I taking chances with my life? Physician, heal thyself. 

I stayed at the Johnson house for more than an hour, until the Boudreaux boy and the 
body of George Johnson were taken away There were questions I had to ask Christine 
Johnson for my report. 

Then I called home and spoke to Nana. I told her to please go to bed. I was safe and 
basically sound. For tonight, anyway 

"I love you, Alex," she whispered over the phone. Nana sounded almost as tired and 
beat-up as I was. 

"! love you, too, old woman," I told her. 

That night, miracle of miracles, she actually let me get in the last word. 

The crowd of ambulance-chasers on Summer Street finally broke up. Even the most 
persistent reporters and photographers left. One of Christine Johnson's sisters had arrived 
to be with her in this terrible time. I hugged Christine hard before I left. 

She was still trembling. She had suffered a horrible, unspeakable loss. We had both spent 
a night in hell. "I can't feel anything. Everything is so unreal," she told me. "I know this 
isn't a nightmare, and yet I keep thinking that it has to be one." 

Sampson drove me home at one in the morning. My eyes felt lidless. My brain was still 
going at a million miles an hour, still buzzing loudly, still overheated. 

What was our world coming to? Gary Soneji? Bundy? The Hillside Strangler? Koresh? 
McVeigh? On and on and on. Gandhi was asked once what he thought of Western 
civilization. He replied, "I think it could be a good idea." 

I don't cry too much. I can't. The same is true for a lot of police officers I know. I wish I 
could cry sometimes, let it all out, release the fear and the venom, but it isn't that easy 
Something has gotten blocked up inside. 

I sat on the stairs inside our house. I had been on my way to my bedroom, but I hadn't 
made it. I was trying to cry, but I couldn't. 

I thought about my wife, Maria, who was killed in a drive-by shooting a few years back. 
Maria and I had fit together beautifully That wasn't just selective memory on my part. I 
knew how good love could be -- I knew it was the best thing I'd ever done in my life -- 
and yet here I was alone. I was taking chances with my life. I kept telling everybody that 
I was all right, but I wasn't. 


I don't know how long I stayed there in the darkness with my thoughts. Maybe ten 
minutes, maybe it was much more than that. The house was quiet in a familiar, almost 
comfortable way, but I couldn't be soothed that night. 

I listened to sounds that I had been hearing for years. I remembered being a small boy 
there, growing up with Nana, wondering what I would become someday Now I knew the 
answer to that question. I was a multiple-homicide expert who got to work the biggest, 
nastiest cases. I was the dragonslayer. 

I finally climbed the rest of the stairs and stopped in at Damon and Jannie's room. The 
two of them were fast asleep in the bedroom they share in our small house. 

I love the way Damon andJannie sleep, the trusting, innocent ways of my young son and 
daughter. I can watch them for long stretches, even on a howling-bad night like this one. 
I can't count how many times have peeked in and just stood in the doorway. 

They keep me going, keep me from flying apart some nights. 

They'd gone to sleep wearing funky, heart-shaped sunglasses like the ones the kids wear 
in the singing group called Innocence. 

It was cute as hell. Precious, too. I sat on the edge of Jannie's bed. 

I quietly took off my boots and carefully lay them on the floor without making any noise. 

Then I stretched myself out across the bottom of both their beds. I listened to my bones 
crack. I wanted to be near my kids, to be with them, for all of us to be safe. It didn't 
seem too much to ask out of life, too much reward for the day I had just lived through. 

I gently kissed the rubber-soled slipper-sock of Jannie's pajamas. 

I lay my hand very lightly against Damon's cool bare leg. 

I finally closed my eyes, and I tried to push the rushing scenes of murder and chaos out of 
my mind. I couldn't do it. The monsters were everywhere that night. They truly were all 
around me. 

There are so goddamn many of them. Wave upon wave, it seems, Young and old, and 
everything in between. Where are these monsters coming from in America? What has 
created them? 

Lying there alongside my two children, I finally was able to sleep somehow. For a few 
hours, was able to forget the most horrifying thing of all, the reason for my extreme 
sorrow and upset. 


I had heard the news before I left the Johnson house. President Thomas Byrnes had died 


early that morning. 
I WAS HOLDING and gently petting Rosie the cat. I had the kitchen door open and 
peered outside, squinted at Sampson. 


He stood in a freezing-cold rain. He looked like a big, dark boulder in the teeming 
rainstorm, or maybe it was hail that he was weathering so stoically 
"The nightmare continues," he said to me. A simple declarative sentence. Devastating. 


"Year, doesn't it, though? But maybe I don't care about it anymore." 
"Uh-huh. And maybe this is the year the Bullets win the NBA championship, the Orioles 
win the World Series, and the raggedyass Redskins go to the Super Bowl. You just never 
know." 


A day had passed since the long night at the Johnson house, since the even longer 
morning in New York City. Not nearly enough time for any kind of healing, or even 
proper grieving. 

President Edward Mahoney had been sworn in the day before. 
It was necessary according to law, but it almost seemed indecent to me. 
I had on dungarees and a white T-shirt. Bare feet on a cold linoleum floor. Steaming 


coffee mug in hand. I was convalescing nicely. I hadn't washed off my whiskers, as 
Jannie calls the act of shaving. I was almost feeling human again. 


I hadn't asked Sampson in yet, either. 
"Morning, Sugar," Sampson persisted. Then he rolled back his upper lip and showed off 
some teeth. His smile was brutally joyful. I finally had to smile back at my friend and 
nemesis. 


It was a little past nine o'clock and I had just gotten up. This was late for me. It was 
shameful behavior by Nana's standards. I was still sleep-deprived, trauma-shocked, in 
danger of losing the rest of my mind, throwing up, something shitty and unexpected. 


But I was also much better. I looked good; I looked fine. 
"Aren't you even going to say good morning?" Sampson asked, pretending to be hurt. 
"Morning, John. I don't even want to know about it," I said to him. "Whatever it is that 


brings you here this cold and bleak morning." 



"First intelligent thing I've heard out of your mouth in years," Sampson said, "but I'm 
afraid I don't believe it. You want to know everything. You need to know everything, 
Alex. That's why you read four newspapers every damn morning." 

"I don't want to know, either," Nana contributed from behind me in the kitchen. She had 
been up for hours, of course. "I don't need to know. Shoo, fly Go fry some ice. Take a 
long walk off a short dock, Johnnyboy" 

"We got time for breakfast?" I finally asked him. 

"Not really," he said, careful to keep his smile turned on, "but let's eat, anyway Who 
could resist?" 

"He invited you, not me," Nana warned from over by her hot stove. 

She Was kidding Sampson. She loves him as if he were her own son, as if he were my 
physically bigger brother. She made the two of us scrambled eggs, homemade sausage, 
home fries, toast. She knows how to cook and could easily feed the entire Washington 
Redskins team at training camp. That would be no problem for Nana. 

Sampson waited until we had finished eating before he got back into it, whatever it was, 
whatever had happened now. His dark little secret. It may seem odd--but when your life 
is filled with homicides and other tragedies, you have to learn to take time for yourself. 
The homicides will still be there. The homicides are always there. 

"Your Mister Grayer called me a little while ago," Sampson said as he poured his third 
cup of coffee. "He said to let you have a couple days off, that they could handle this. 
Them, like the great old horror flick that used to scare the hell out of us." 

"That, what you just said, makes me suspicious and fearful right away. Handle what?" I 
asked. 

I was finishing the last of half a loaf of cinnamon toast made from thick homemade 
bread. It was, honestly, quite seriously, a taste of heaven. Nana claims that she's been 
there, stolen several recipes. I tend to believe her. I've seen and tasted the proof of her 
tale. 

Sampson glanced at his wristwatch, an ancient Bulova given to him by his father when he 
was fourteen. 

"They're looking over Jill's office in the White House right about now. Then they're going 
to her apartment on Twenty-fourth Street. You want to go? As my guest? Got you a 
guest pass, just in case." 

Of course I wanted to be there. I had to go. I needed to know everything about Jill, just 
as Sampson had said I did. 


"You are the devil," Nana hissed at Sampson. 

"Thank you, Nana." He beamed bright eyes and a thousand and one teeth. "High praise, 
indeed." 

WE DROVE to Sara Rosen's apartment in Sampson's slippery-quick black Nissan. 
Nana's hot breakfast had brought me back to the real world at least. I was feeling 
partially revived. Physically, if not emotionally. 

I was already highly intrigued about visiting Jill's home. I wanted to see her office at the 
White House, too, but figured that could wait a day or two. But her house. That was 
irresistible for the detective, and for the psychologist. 

Sara Rosen lived in a ten-story building on Twenty-fourth and K. The building had an 
officious front-desk "captain" who studied our police IDs and then reluctantly let us 
proceed. The lobby was cheery otherwise. Carpeted, lots of large potted plants. 

Not the kind of building where anyone would expect to find an assassin. 

But Jill had lived right here, hadn't she? 

Actually, the apartment fit the profile we had of Sara Rosen. 

She was the only child of an Army colonel and a high school English teacher. She had 
grown up in Aberdeen, Maryland, then gone to Hollins College in Virginia. She had 
majored in history and English, graduating with honors. She'd come to Washington 
sixteen years ago, when she was twenty-one. She had never married, though she'd had 
several boyfriends over the years. Some of the staff at the White House press and 
communications offices called her "the sexy spinster." 

Her apartment was on the fifth floor of the ten-story building. 

It was bright, with a view of an interior courtyard. The FBI was already at work inside. 
Chopin came softly from a stereo. It was a relaxed atmosphere, almost pleasant, devil-
may-care. The case was, after all, closed. 

Sampson and I spent the next few hours with the Feebie technicians who were searching 
the apartment for anything that might give the Bureau a clue about Sara Rosen. 

Jill had lived right there. 

Who the hell were you, Jill? How did this happen to you? What happened, Jill? Talk to 
us. You know you want to talk, lonely girl. 


Her apartment was a one-bedroom with a small den, and we would examine every square 
inch of it. The woman who had lived here had helped to murder President Thomas 
Byrnes. The den had been used as an editing room for their film. The apartment had 
historical importance now. For as long as this building stood, people would point at it 
and say, "That's where Jill lived." 

She had bought anonymous-looking furniture in a country-club style. They were middle-
class trappings. A sofa and armchair made of brushed cotton twill. Local furniture store 
tags: Mastercraft Interiors, Colony House in Arlington. Cool, cold colors in every room. 
Lots of ivory-colored things at Jill's place. 

An ice-blue, patterned area rug. A pale, distressed pine armoire. 

Several frames on the wall contained matted Christmas cards and letters from White 
House notables: the current press secretary, the chief of staff, even a brief note from 
Nancy Reagan. 

There were no pictures of any of the "enemies" mentioned to me by President Byrnes. 
Sara Rosen was a secret starfucker, wasn't she? Had Jack been a star for her? Was Jack 
really Kevin Hawkins? 

Talk to us, Jill. I know you want to talk. Tell us what really happened. Give us a clue. 

Sitting out on a small rolltop desk were mailings from the Heritage Foundation and the 
Cato Institute, both conservative organizations. There were several copies of U.S. News 
& World Report, Southern Living, Gourmet. 

Also flyers about future poetry readings at Chapters on K Street, and Politics and Prose, 
bookstores in the Washington area. Was Jill the poet? 

A poem had been cut from a book and taped to the wall above the desk. 

How dreary -- to be -- Somebody! 

How public -- like a Frog -To tell one's name -- the live-long June -To an admiring Bog! 
-- Emily Dickinson Emily Dickinson apparently had the same opinion of celebrities as 
Jack and Jill. 

The walls of the den and bedroom were covered with books. 

The walls were bookcases. Fiction, nonfiction, poetry. High- and low-brow stuff. Jill 
the reader. Jill the loner. Jill the sexy spinster. 

Who are you, Jill? Who are you, Sara Rosen ? 


There was even one bit of evidence that showed a sense of humor. A sign was framed in 
the front hallway: use an accordion, go to jail. That's the law. 


Who are you, Sara-Jill? 
Did anybody really care about you before now ? Why did you help to commit this 
horrible crime? Was it worth it? To die like this, a lonely spinster? Who killed you, Jill 
? Was it Jack? 


If I found one indisputable piece of truth, just one, all the rest would follow, and we 


would finally understand. I wanted to believe that it could go like that. 
I looked through Jill's clothes closets. I found conservative business suits mostly in dark 
colors. Labels that told me Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor. Low pumps, running 
shoes, casual flats. There were several sweatsuits for running and exercise. 


Not many evening dresses for parties, for fun. 
Who were you, Sara? 
I searched for false walls, false bottoms, anywhere that she might have kept private notes, 


something that might help us to close this case forever, or open it wide. 
C'mon, Sara, let us in on your secret life. Tell us who you really were. 
What kept you going, Jill ? Who were you, Sara? Sexy spinster? 
You want us to know. I know you do. You're still in this apartment. 
I can feel it. I can feel your loneliness everywhere I look. 
You want us to know something. What is it, Sara? Give us one more rhyme. Just one. 
Sampson came up behind me while I was standing at a bedroom window overlooking the 


courtyard. I was thinking about all the possibilities the case held. 
"You got it solved yet? Got it all figured out, Sweets?" 
"Not yet. There's something more, though. Give me another couple of days here." 
Sampson groaned at the thought. And so did I. But I knew I would come back here. 


Sara Rosen had left something for us to remember her by. I was almost sure of it. 
Jill the poet. 



MAYBE I WAS a glutton for crime and punishment, but I came back alone to her 
apartment very early the following morning. 

I was there by eight, long before anyone else. I wandered back and forth in the small 
apartment, nibbling from an open box of Nutri-Grain. 

Something was still bothering me about the sexy spinster and her hideaway in Foggy 
Bottom. Detective's hunch. Psychologist's intuition. 

For nearly an hour, I sat crouched at a window seat that looked out on K Street. I fixated 
on a bus shelter poster for a Calvin Klein perfume called Escape. The model in the poster 
looked unbearably sad and forlorn. Like Jill? Someone had written a thought balloon 
above the model's head. It read: "Someone feed me, please." 

What gave Sara Rosen sustenance? I wondered as I peered out into the D.C. ether. 
What was her secret? What drove her to the madness of celebrity stalking--or whatever 
she had been doing before she was killed in the Peninsula Hotel? She had been murdered 
in New York. What was her connection to Jack? 

What was the whole story? What was the real story? What secret still hadn't been 
unlocked? 

I started in on the massive collection of books that dominated every room in the 
apartment, even the kitchen. Sara had been a voracious reader. Mostly literature and 
history, nearly all of it American. Sara the intellectual; Sara the real smart cookie. 

Diplomacy by Henry Kissinger. Special Trust by Robert McFarland. Caveat by 
Alexander Haig. Kissinger by Walter Isaacson. On and on and on. Fiction by Anne 
Tyler, Robertson Davies, Annie Proulx, but also Robert Ludlum and John Grisham. 
Poetry by Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton. 

A volume entitled Woman Alone. 

I opened each book, then carefully shook it out. There were well over a thousand 
volumes in the apartment. Maybe a couple of thousand. Lots of books to look through. 

There were handwritten pages of notes stuffed into some of the books. Jottings Sara had 
made. I read every loose scrap. The hours went by. Meals were skipped. I didn't much 
care. 

Inside a biography of Napoleon and Josephine, Sara Rosen had written "N. considered 
high intelligence an aberration in women. Stroked J."s breasts in public. Cur. But J. got 
her just deserts. Cunt." 


Jill the poet. Jill the book lover. The mystery, the fantasy woman, the enigma. The 
killer. 

There were several videotapes of movies in the den, and I began to open each of the 
containers. 

Sara Rosen's film collection featured well-known romances, mystery thrillers, and 
romantic thrillers. The Prince of Tides, No Way Out, Disclosure, The Godfather trilogy, 
Gone With the Wind, An Officer and a Gentleman. 

She also seemed to like older movies, especially noir mysteries: Raymond Chandler, 
James Cain, Hitchcock. 

I opened every single cassette, row by row, every box. I thought it was important, 
especially with someone as orderly as Sara. If Sampson had been around, I wouldn't 
have heard the end of it. He would have called me crazier than Jack or Jill. 

I opened a cassette box for Hitchcock's Notorious. I didn't remember ever seeing the film 
myself, but one of Hitchcock's favorite male leads, Cary Grant, was featured on the box 
cover. 

I found an unmarked cassette inside the box. It didn't look like a movie. Curious, I 
popped the cassette into the VCR. It was the fourth or fifth unmarked cassette that I had 
viewed so far. 

The film wasn't Notorious. 

I found myself looking at footage of the murder of Senator Daniel Fitzpatrick. 

This was apparently the uncut version, which ran considerably longer than the film that 
had been sent to CNN. 

The extra footage was even more disturbing and graphic than what had been viewed on 
the TV news network. The fear in Senator Fitzpatrick's voice was terrible to hear. He 
begged the killers for his life, then he began to cry, to sob loudly That part had been 
carefully edited from the CNN tape. It was too strong. It was brutal beyond belief. It put 
Jack and Jill in the worst possible light. 

They were merciless killers. No pity, no passion, no humanity I jabbed at the PAUSE 
button. Jackpot! The next shot in the film had started tight on Senator Fitzpatrick, then 
pulled out to a wide angle, maybe wider than intended. 

The tape showed Jack as he fired the second shot. 

The killer wasn't Kevin Hawkins! 


I suddenly wondered if Jill had left the tape here for someone to find. Had she suspected 
that she might be betrayed? Was this Jill's payback? I thought that maybe it was: Jill had 
fucked Jack, straight from hell. 

I studied the frozen frame revealing the real Jack. He had short, sandy-blond hair. He 
was a handsome-looking man in his late thirties. There was no emotion on his face as he 
pulled the trigger. 

"Jack," I whispered. "We've finally found you, Jack." 

THE FBI, Secret Service, and Washington police cooperated and worked closely together 
on a massive and important manhunt. 
They all badly wanted a piece of this one. It was the ultimate homicide case: a president 

had been murdered. The real killer was still out there. Jack was still alive; at least, I 
hoped that he was. 

And he was! 
Early on the morning of December 20, I watched Jack through a pair of binoculars. I 
couldn't take my eyes off the killer and mastermind. 


I wanted to take him down. I wanted him for myself. We had to wait, though. This was 


Jay Grayer's plan. It was his day, his show, his plan of action. 
Jack was just walking out of a three-story Colonial house. He went to a bright red Ford 
Bronco that sat in a circular driveway. 


By then, we knew who he was, where he lived, nearly everything about him. Now we 
understood a lot more about Jack and Jill. 
Our eyes had been opened very, very wide. 


"There's Jack. There's our boy," Jay Grayer said to me. 
"Doesn't look like a killer, does he?" I said. "But he got the job done. He did it. He's the 
executioner of all those people, including Jill." 


Jack was herding along a small boy and a girl. Very cute kids. I knew that their names 
were Alix and Artie. Also coming along for the ride were the two family dogs: Shepherd 
and Wise Man, a ten-year-old black retriever and a frisky young collie. 

Jack's kids. 
Jack's dogs. 


Jacks nice house in suburbia. 
Jack and Jill came to The Hill... to kill the President. And then Jack murdered his 
partner and lover, Jill. He executed Sara Rosen in cold blood Jack thought he got away 

with the murders, clear and free. Jack had an almost great plan. But now we had Jack in 
our sights. I was watching Jack. We all were. 
He looked like the perfect suburban Washington dad in just about every way. He had on 

a navy hooded parka that was unzipped in spite of the cold weather. The open jacket 
exposed a blue plaid flannel shirt and stonewashed dungarees. He wore floppy, tannish 
brown Topsiders, gray woolen socks. 

His hair was cut short, military-style. His hair was dark brown now. He was a ruggedly 
handsome man. Thirty-nine years old. 
The President's assassin. The stone-cold killer of several political enemies. 
A conspirator. 
A world-class traitor. 


A real heartless bastard, too. 
He is just about the perfect American killer, I thought as I watched him in command of 
his obedient troop of children and pets. He was a near-perfect assassin. He was a daddy, 
a husband, clean-cut as could be. He looked absolutely beyond suspicion. 


He even had alibis, though none of them would hold up because of the film footage of his 
shooting Senator Fitzpatrick. A Jackal for our age, for our country, for our naive and 
very dangerous way of life. 

I wondered if he had watched the President's burial ceremony on TV, or maybe even 
attended it, as I had. 

"He's such a devil-may-care fucker, isn't he?Jay Grayer said. 
He was sitting beside me in the front seat of the unmarked car. I hadn't heard Jay Grayer 
curse much before today. He wanted to take down Jack real bad, real hard. 


That's what we were going to do. This was going to be a famous morning for all of us. 
It was all about to go down. 
"Get ready to follow Jack," Grayer spoke into a handheld mike in our car. "You lose 


him, anybody, and you can just keep going. 



In whatever direction you're headed." 

"We won't lose him. I don't think he'll even run," I said. 

"He's a homebody, our Jack. He's a daddy. He has roots in the community." 

What a strange country we lived in. So many murderers. So many monsters. So many 
decent people for them to prey on. 

"I think you're probably right, Alex. Spot on. I don't get it yet, I don't fully understand 
him, but I think you're right. We've got him nailed. Only what exactly do we have here? 
What makes Jack run? Why did he do it?" 

"Money," I told him a theory I had about Jack. "Look for the money. It cuts through and 
simplifies all the other stuff. A little politics, a little cause, and a lot of money. Ideology 
and financial gain. Hard to beat in this venal day and age." 

"You think so?" 

"I think so. Yes. I'd bet a lot on it. He has some strongly held beliefs, and one of them is 
that he and his family deserve to live well. So, yes, I think money is a part of this. I think 
he's probably acquainted with some people with a lot of money and power, but not as 
much power as they would like to have." 

The Bronco took off and we followed it at a comfortable distance. Jack was a careful 
driver of his valuable cargo. He must have been impressive to his kids, maybe even to 
the dogs, undoubtedly to his neighbors. 

Jack the Jackal. I wondered if that was another of Sara Rosen's word games. 

I wondered what Jill's very last thought was when her lover betrayed her in New York. 
Had she expected it? Had she known he would betray her? Was that why she left the 
cassette in her apartment? 

Jay wanted to talk, maybe he needed to keep his mind busy right now. "He's taking them 
to the day school down yonder. His life is back to normal now. Nothing happened to 
change that. He just planned the murder and helped execute a president. That's all. No 
biggie. Life goes on." 

"From what I can gather in his military records, he was a first-class soldier. He left the 
Army as a full colonel. Honorable discharge. Participated in Desert Storm," I said to Jay. 

"Jack a war hero. I'm impressed as hell. I'm so goddamn impressed with this guy that I 
can't begin to tell you. Maybe I'll tell him." 

Jack was a war hero, officially. 


Jack was a patriot, unofficially. 
As we rode along, I remembered the inscription on the Tomb of the Unknown at 


Arlington National Cemetery. Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known 
but to God. Somehow, I thought that was how Jack probably thought about himself. 
A soldier-hero known only to God. 
He probably believed he'd gotten away with several murders -- in a just war. 
Well, he hadn't. He was about to go down. 
He dropped the two children off at the Bayard-Wellington School. It was a beautiful 


place: fieldstone walls and rolling, frost-slicked lawns; the sort of school I would have 
loved to send Damon andJannie to; the kind of school where Christine Johnson ought to 
teach. 

You could move out of D.C., you know, I told myself as I watched Jack kiss each of his 

children good-bye. 
So why don't you? Why don't you take Damon and Jannie away from Fifth Street? Why 
don't you do what this rotten piece of shit son of a bitch does for his kids? 


Jay Grayer spoke into the hand mike again. "He's leaving the Bayard-Wellington School 
now. He's turning back onto the main road. God, it's pretty out here in Jackville, isn't it? 
We'll take him down at the stoplight up ahead! Just one imperative: we take him alive! 
We'll have four cars at the light with him. Four of us to get Jack. We take him alive." 

"You have the right to remain silent," I said. 
"What the hell are you saying?" Jay Grayer turned to me and asked. 
"Just getting it out of the way He doesn't have any rights. He's going down." 
Grayer offered up a crooked smile. We both understood why The good part was coming 


now. The only good part in this whole affair. "Famous stuff, huh? Here we go. Let's 
get this son of a bitch." 
"Absolutely I want to have a nice long talk with Jack, too." 
I want to kick his ass from this stoplight, all the way back to Washington. 
I want to meet the real Jack. 



NOBODY had figured out the assassination plot until now. Not one of us had even been 
close. No one had been able to solve the mystery of Jack and Jill until it was too late. 
Maybe we could unravel the whole mess now. A retrospective on Jack and Jill. 

We were less than a hundred yards away from capturing Jack. 
He was heading down a steep, rolling hill toward a stoplight. 
It was a very picturesque scene. Long lens, like in expensively made movies. The light 


turned red and Jack stopped like a law-abiding citizen. Unconcerned about anything. 
A free man. 
Jay Grayer and I eased up right behind his trendy, off-road vehicle. 
I could read the sticker on the rear bumper of the Bronco: D.A.R.E. to keep kids off 


drugs. 
Beartrap was the code for our operation. We had four mainline vehicles. Another half-
dozen cars and two helicopters for backup. I didn't see how Jack could escape. I was 


thinking ahead to the massive ramifications of the assassin's capture, and the even more 
shocking surprise still to come. 
This was going to get worse, much worse. 
"We take him down on three," Jay Grayer said into his hand mike. He was extremely 


cool now, the consummate professional, as he had been from the beginning. I liked 
working with him enormously. He wasn't an egomaniac; he was just good at his job. 
"We take him real easy," I said. 


The beartrap was sprung. 
I was one of the six who jumped out of the intercept cars stopped at the innocent-looking 
country-road light. It was an honor. 


There were two civilian cars waiting at the light as well. A gray Honda and a Saab. 
It must have looked like utter madness to them. That's because it was, and much worse 
than it looked. The man in the Bronco had killed the President. This was like arresting 


Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan,John Wilkes Booth. An ordinary stoplight in northern 
Maryland. 
I was there] I was glad I was there. I would have paid a huge admission price to be there 


for this. 



I got to the passenger door of his vehicle as a Secret Service agent yanked open the 
driver's door. The two of us happened to be the quickest on our feet. Or maybe we were 
the ones who wanted Jack the most. 

Jack turned toward me -- and he got to look right into the wide-eyed barrel of my Glock. 
He got a real good look at death in an instant. 
Execution-style! 
Very professional! 
"Don't move. Don't even breathe too hard. Don't move a millimeter," I said to him. "I 


don't want to have an excuse. So don't give me one." 


He hadn't been expecting us. I could tell that by the shock spread across his face. He 
thought he'd gotten away clean with the murders. Thought he was home free. 
Well, he had it all wrong for once. 
Jack had finally made his first mistake. 
"Secret Service. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, and that's a real 


good idea!" one of the agents barked at Jack. The agent's face was bright red with anger, 
with outrage at this man who had murdered President Thomas Byrnes. 
Jack looked at the Secret Service agent, and then back at me. 


He recognized me. He knew who I was. What else did he know? 
At first he'd been startled, but now he became calm. It was astonishing to see the 
calmness and cool take hold. He's calm as death, I thought. 


I shouldn't have been surprised. This was the real Jack. This was the President killer. 


"Very good," he finally said, commending us for doing a good job, for our 
professionalism. The son of a bitch nodded his approval. 
"I'm proud of you. You did your jobs extremely well." It made my blood boil, but I knew 


the order of the day: we take him real easy. The gentle beartrap. 
He slowly got out of the spit-shined red vehicle. Both his hands were held up high. He 
offered no resistance; he didn't want to be shot. 



Suddenly, one of the Secret Service agents sucker punched him. The agent threw a hard 
roundhouse right that connected with the killer's jaw. I couldn't believe he'd done it, but I 
was glad. 

Jack's head snapped back and he dropped like a stone. Jack was smart. He stayed down. 
There was no provocation for the agent's punch, no excuse whatsoever--except that the 
freak sprawled on the ground had murdered the President in cold blood. 

Jack shook his head and worked his jaw as he looked up at us from the pavement. "How 
much do you know?" he asked. 

We didn't answer him. None of us said a goddamn word. It was our turn to play games. 
Now we had a few surprises for Jack. 

JACK WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING. We knew he was only part of the puzzle we 
were attempting to solve. We had decided to take him down first, but now came the 
second crucial stop. 

As we rode back to his house on Oxford Street, I felt distant from the scene, almost as if I 
were watching myself in a dream. I remembered the few meetings I'd had with Thomas 
Byrnes. He'd told us all to have no regrets, but that advice didn't work out in the real 
world. The President was dead, and I would always feel partly responsible, even if I 
wasn't responsible at all. 

I wasn't thinking only about the President's murder. There was thirteen-year-old Danny 
Boudreaux. I felt an unsettling connection between the two cases. I had from the very 
beginning. The murders and unprecedented violence were everywhere. It was as if a 
strange, crippling disease were spreading across much of the world, but especially right 
here in America. I had already witnessed too much of it. I didn't know how to make the 
nightmare stop. No one did. 

It wasn't over. 

We were finally at the beginning of the awful mystery. 

This was where it had started. 

At this house just coming into view. 

Jay Grayer spoke into the car's hand mike. "Dr. Cross and I will go the front-door route. 
Everyone cover us like a blanket. 

No shooting. Not even return fire, if you can help it. Everybody clear on that?" 

All the other agents were clear on the procedure and knew the stakes. Beartrap wasn't 
over yet. 


Grayer pulled the black sedan up beside the front walk to the house. "You ready for one 
more shitstorm?" he asked me. "You okay with how this is going down, Alex?" 

"I'm as okay as I'm going to be," I told him. "Thanks for keeping me in the loop. I 
needed to be here." 

"We wouldn't even be here without you. Let's go do it." 

The two of us got out of his unmarked car and hurried up the red-brick front walkway 
together. We matched each other, step for step. 

This was where it had all started. 

The big house, the whole street, seemed so innocent and appealing. 

A beautiful, white Colonial stood before us. The house had a big old porch supported by 
column pedestals. Children's bikes were neatly stacked on the porch. Everything out 
here was so neat. Was it all a disguise? Of course it was. 

Jay Grayer rang the doorbell and it sounded like the "Avon calling" bell. Jack and Jill 
came to The Hill But Jack and Jill started right here, didn't it? In this very house. 

The door was answered by a woman wearing a red plaid robe that looked as if it came 
straight out of the J. Crew catalog. 

A grapevine wreath, one of those peculiar, decorative affairs that looks. like Jesus' crown 
of thorns, was hung on the front door for the holidays. It had a big red bow tied around 
it. Here is Jill, I was thinking. Finally, the real Jill. 

"ALEX, JAY. My God, what is it? What's happened now? Don't tell me this is a social 
visit?" 

Jeanne Sterling stood just inside the front door of her house. I could see a polished oak 
stairway glistening behind her. A formal dining room was visible through pocket doors, 
which were also polished oak. A tall stack of gift-wrapped Christmas presents lay piled 
near a desk and a six-foot-high standing mirror in the foyer. 

Jill's house. The inspector general of the CIA. Clean Jeanne. 

"What's happened? I just made some coffee. Please, come in." 

She sounded as if Jay Grayer and I were a couple of neighbors from just down the street. 
A social visit, right? She smiled and her prominent teeth made it look like a grimace. 


What happened? Has someone in the neighborhood been involved in a fender bender? I 
just made fresh coffee. Good as the stuff at Starbucks. Let's chat. 

"Coffee sounds fine,"Jay said, showing he could chat with the best of them. 

We walked inside the house that she shared with her children and her husband. With 
Jack. 

I noticed details -- everything seemed important, telling, evidence. The bright colors and 
exuberant style on the inside of the house said "American," but the accents 
communicated "world travel." French etchings. Flemish weavings. Chinese porcelain. 

Jill the traveler. Jill the spymaster. 

There's an old saying in classic mysteries, which I'd never felt made much sense -- 
cherchez la femme. Look for the woman. I had my own catchphrase for solving many 
modern-day mysteries -- cherchez l' argent. Look for the money. 

I didn't believe that Jeanne Sterling and her husband had acted on their own. I didn't 
believe it any more than I had ever bought that Jack and Jill were celebrity stalkers. 
Aldrich Ames had supposedly received two and a half million for exposing a dozen 
American agents. How much had the Sterlings received for disposing of a troublesome 
United States president? A loose cannon who had gone against the system? 

And who had given them the money? Cherchez l'argent. Maybe Jeanne would tell us if 
we twisted her arm a little, which I definitely planned to do. 

Who would gain the most from the murder of President Thomas Byrnes? The vice 
president, now the president? Wall Street? Organized crime? The CIA? I would have 
to ask Jeanne about that. Maybe over steaming pewter mugs of coffee. Maybe that was 
what we could chat about. 

She turned and led the way back to her kitchen. She was so calm and collected. I 
continued to notice the furnishings, the pristine decor, the neatness, even with three kids 
in the house. 

I thought that I knew how Jeanne and her husband could afford such a terrific house out 
here in Chevy Chase. Cherchez l'argent. 

"There's been some kind of a break, hasn't there?" she said and turned to look at us. "You 
have me completely baffled as to what it could be. What's happened? Tell me." She 
rubbed her hands together gleefully. Quite an act. Quite an actress. 

"There has been a break," I finally said. "We've found out some interesting things about 
Jack." We decided to take him down first. Now it's your turn. 


"That's excellent news," Jeanne Sterling said. "Please, tell me everything. After all, 
Kevin Hawkins was one of ours." 

We entered a large kitchen, which I remembered from my first visit there. The walls 
were covered with terra cotta tiles and expensive-looking wooden cabinets. Half a dozen 
windows looked out on a gazebo and a tennis court. 

"We've arrested your husband, Brett, for the murder of the President,"Jay Grayer told her 
in a cold, flat voice. "We have him in custody right now. We're here to arrest you." 

"It's so damn hard to control every single detail, isn't it? One little slipup was all it took," 
I said to Jeanne. "Sara made a mistake. 

I think she fell in love with your husband. Did you know that? You must have known 
about Sara and Brett's affair?" 

"Alex, what are you saying? What areyou saying, Jay? Neither of you is making any 
sense." 

"Oh, sure we are,Jeanne. Sara Rosen kept a dupe of the footage of Senator Fitzpatrick's 
murder at her apartment in D.C. Your husband is on the tape. She was in love with him, 
the poor spinster. 

Maybe you planned on that. You must have at least suspected it. We even have a partial 
fingerprint of his at Sara Rosen's apartment in Foggy Bottom. We'll probably find more 
now that we know what to look for." 

Her look darkened, her eyes narrowed into slits. I sensed she might not have known 
everything about her husband's close "relationship" with Sara Rosen. 

She knew about Sara, of course. In the last few days, we had discovered that Sara Rosen 
had been an Agency spy inside the White House. She had been the Agency's mole there 
for eight years. That was how Jack had found her, and knew she would be loyal. Sara 
Rosen had been the perfect Jill. Sara had believed in "the cause," at least as much as she 
was told about it. She was extremely right-wing. Thomas Byrnes wanted massive 
changes at the Pentagon and CIA. A powerful group felt the changes could destroy the 
country, would destroy the country. They had decided to destroy President Byrnes 
instead. Jack and Jill had been born. 

Jay Grayer said, "This is going to be worse than Aldrich Ames, you know. Much, much 
worse." 

Jeanne Sterling slowly nodded her head. "Yes, I suppose it will be. I suppose," she 
continued, her eyes trailing back and forth between Grayer and me, "that you're proud to 
be a part of the destruction of one of the few, the very few, advantages the United States 
holds over the rest of the world. Our intelligence network was second to none. It still is, 


in my opinion. The President was a foolish amateur who wanted to dismantle 
intelligence and the milita In the name of what? Populist change? What a mock-cry, 
what a sad, dangerous joke. Thomas Byrnes was a car salesman from Detroit! He had no 
business making the decisions he was entrusted With. Most presidents before him 
understood that. 

I don't care what you believe about us. My husband and I are patriots. Are we clear on 
that? Are we clear, gentlemen?" 

Jay Grayer let her finish before he spoke again. "You and your husband are slimy 
traitors. You're both murderers. Are we clear? 

You're right about one thing, though. I am proud about bringing you down. I feel great 
about that. I really do,Jeanne." 

There was a sudden flare of bright white light in the kitchen! 

A muzzle flash. 

A deafening shot rang out in the most unexpected of places. Jay Grayer's body arched. 
He fell back against the kitchen counter, knocking over a row of tall wooden stools. 

Jeanne Sterling had shot him point-blank. She had a gun hidden in her robe. She'd fired 
right- through the pocket. Maybe she had seen us approaching the house. Or maybe she 
always had a gun nearby. She was Jill, after all. 

Jeanne shifted her feet and turned the gun on me. I was already diving down behind the 
kitchen counter. 

She fired the semiautomatic anyway. 

Another deafening blast in the kitchen. A flash of light. Then another shot. 

She kept firing as she backed from the kitchen. Then she ran. 

Her robe flew behind her like a cape. 

I quickly moved to where Jay Grayer had gone down. He was wounded high in the chest, 
near the collarbone. His face was drained of color. Jay was conscious, though. "Just get 
her, Alex. 

Get her alive," he gasped. "Get them. They know everything." 

I moved carefully but quickly inside the Sterling house. Don't kill her. She knows the 
truth. We need to hear it from her just this once. She knows why the President was 
killed, and who ordered it. 


She knows! 


Suddenly, a Secret Service agent came rushing inside the front door. Another agent was 
close behind him. 
Two more agents appeared from the direction of the kitchen. 
All of them had their guns drawn. Looks of shocked concern were on their faces. 
"What the hell happened in here?" one of the agents shouted. 
"Jeanne Sterling has a gun. We take her alive, anyway We have to take her alive!" 
I heard a noise in the direction of the front hallway Actually, two noises. I understood 


what was happening, and my heart sank. 
A car engine was being started. 
An electric garage door was being raised. 
Jill was getting away. 
MY CHEST was thundering, ready to explode, but my heart had gone icy cold. 
Take her alive, no matter what! She's even more important than Jack. 
The door to the garage was down a narrow hallway that led past a large sun room. The 


sun room was awash in blinding morning light. I sucked in a breath. Then I opened the 
garage door carefully, as if it might explode. It just might, I knew. Anything could 
happen now. This was the house of dirty tricks. 

There was a dark, narrow corridor between the house and the garage. The passageway 
was about four feet long. I moved down it in a low crouch. 
Another closed door was at the end. 


Take her alive. That the one imperative. 
I yanled open the second door and jumped out into what I figured had to be the garage. It 
was. 


Instantly, I heard three loud pops. I hit the concrete floor hard. 
Gunshots! 


Thunderous, scary noise in the confined space. No thud of a bullet to my chest or head, 


thank God. 
I saw Jeanne Sterling leaning out of the window of her station wagon. She had a 
semiautomatic clutched in one hand. I pushed myself up again. 


Take her alive! my brain screamed as I ducked out of sight. 
I had seen something else in the car. She had her youngest daughter with her. Her three


year-old, Karon. She was using Karon as a shield. She knew we wouldn't shoot with the 
girl in the way The little girl was screaming loudly. She was terrified. 
How could Jeanne Sterling do this to a child? 
I crouched behind the oil tank in the darkened, cramped space. 
I was trying to think straight. 
I shut my eyes for a beat. Half a second at most. 
I drank in a huge breath of cold air and gasoline fumes. Tried to think in absolutely 


straight lines. I made a decision and hoped it was the right one. 
When I came up again, I fired. I carefully aimed away from the little girl. But I fired. 
I went down in the crouch again, hidden behind the dark tank. 
I knew I hadn't hit anybody My shot had only been a warning, a final one. Andrew 


Klauk had been right when we'd talked in the Sterlings' backyard. The CIA "ghost" was 
the one who told me all I needed to know right now -- the game is played with no rules. 
"Jeanne, put the goddamn gun down!" I called to her. "Your little girl is in danger." 


No answer came back, just terrifying silence. 
Jeanne Sterling would do whatever it took to get away. She had murdered a president, 
ordered it done, helped plan every step. 


Would Jeanne Sterling really sacrifice her own child, though? 
For what? For money? A cause she and her husband believed in? 
What cause could be worth the life of a president? Of your own child? 
Take her alive. Even if she deserves to die here in this garage. 



Execution-style. 

I popped up again. I fired a second shot into the car windJack and shield -- the driver's 
side, far right. Glass shattered all over the garage. Glass fragments sprayed against the 
ceiling, then rained back down again. 

The noise was deafening in the closed space. Karon was sobbing and screeching. 

I could see Jeanne Sterling through the mosaic of broken windshield glass. There was 
blood all over one side of her face. 

She looked startled and shocked. It's one thing to plan a murder, quite another to be shot 
at. Io be wounded. To take a hit. Io feel that deadly thud in your own body I took three 
fast steps toward the Volvo station wagon. 

I grabbed the car door and yanked it open. I kept my head down low, close to my chest. 
My teeth were gritted so hard that they hurt. 

I grabbed a full handful of Jeanne Sterling's blond hair. Ihen I hit her. I popped Jeanne 
with a full, hard shot. Same as her husband got. The right side of her face crunched as it 
met my fist. 

Jeanne Sterling sagged over the steering wheel. She must have had a glassjaw. Jeanne 
was a killer, but not much of a prizefighter. 

She went out with the first good punch. We had her now. I had taken her down alive. 

We finally had Jack and Jill. 

Her little girl was crying in the front seat, but she wasn't hurt. 

Neither was the mother. I couldn't have done it any easier, any other way We had Jack, 
and now we had Jill. Maybe we would hear the truth. No -- we would hear the truth! 

I grabbed the little girl and held her tight against me. I wanted to erase all this for her. I 
didn't want her to remember it. I kept repeating, "It's all right, it's all right. Everything is 
all right." 

It wasn't, though. I doubted it ever would be again. Not for the Sterling children, not for 
my own kids. Not for any of us. 

There are no rules anymore. 


THE NIGHT of the capture of Jeanne and Brett Sterling, the television networks were 
filled with the powerful, highly disturbing story. I did a brief interview with CNN, but 
mostly I declined the attention. I went home and stayed there. 

President Edward Mahoney delivered a statement at nine. 

Jack and Jill had wanted Edward Mahoney to be president, I couldn't help thinking as I 
watched him address hundreds of millions of people around the world. Maybe he was 
involved with the shooting; maybe not. But someone had wanted him to be president 
instead of Thomas Byrnes, and Byrnes had distrusted Mahoney. 

All I knew about Mahoney was that he and two Cuban partners had made a fortune in the 
cable business. Mahoney had then become a popular governor of Florida. I remembered 
that there had been a lot of money behind his campaign. Look for the money. 

I watched the dramatic three-ring TV circus along with Nana and the kids. Damon 
andJanelle knew too much to be excluded from the big picture now. From their 
perspective, their daddy was a hero. I was someone to be proud of, and maybe even 
listen to and obey every now and again. But probably not. 

Jannie and Rosie the cat cuddled with me on the couch as we watched the nonstop parade 
of news features on the assassination and the subsequent capture of the real Jack and Jill. 
Every time I appeared in a film sequence, Jannie gave me a kiss on the cheek. "You 
approve of your pop?" I asked her after one of her best, loudest smackers. 

. "Yes, very much so," Jannie told me. "I love seeing you on TV. 

So does Rosie. You're handsome, and you talk real nice. You're my hee-ro." 

"What do you have to say, Damon?" I checked on his royal majesty's reaction to the 
strange goings-on. 

Damon grinned ear to ear. He couldn't help himself. "Pretty good," he admitted. "I feel 
good inside." 

"I hear you," I said to my young cub. "You want to give me a hug?" 

He did, so I knew Damon was happy with me for the moment. 

That was important to me. 

"Mater familias?" I asked for Nana's opinion last. She was propped up in her favorite 
armchair. She hugged herself tightly as she watched the traumatic news coverage with 
rapt attention and a snide commentary 

"Not familias enough lately," Nana offered a quick complaint. 


"Well, mostly I agree withJannie and Damon. I don't see why the white Secret Service 
man is taking most of the credit, though. 

Seems to me that the President got shot on his watch." 

"Maybe he got shot on all of our watches," I said to her. 

Nana shrugged her deceptively frail-looking shoulders. "At any rate, as always, I am 
proud of you, Alex. Has nothing to do with the heroics, though. I'm proud of you 
because of you." 

"Thank you," I told Nana. "Nobody can say anything nicer. 

Not to anybody." 

"I know that," Nana got the last word in; then she finally grinned. "Why do you think I 
said it?" 

I hadn't been home much during the past four weeks, and we were all hungry for one 
another's company. We were starved, in fact. I couldn't walk anywhere in the house 
without one of the kids firmly attached to an arm or leg. 

Even Rosie the cat got into the act. She was definitely family now, and we were all glad 
she'd somehow found her way to our house. 

I didn't mind any of it. Not one minute of the attention. I was starved myself. I had a 
quick regret that my wife, Maria, wasn't around to enjoy the special moment, but the rest 
was okay. Pretty good, actually. Our life was going to get back to normal again now. I 
vowed it would happen this time. 

The next morning I was up to take Damon over to the Sojourner Truth School. The place 
was already bouncing back nicely. Innocence has a short memory. I stopped by 
Christine Johnson's office, but she wasn't back at work yet. 

Nobody knew when she would return to the school, but they all missed her like a cure for 
the flu. So did I, so did i. There was something special about her. I hoped she was going 
to be all right. 

I got home at quarter to nine that morning. The house on Fifth Street was incredibly 
quiet and peaceful. Kind of nice, actually. I put on Billie Holiday: The Legacy 19331958. 
One of my all-time favorites. 

The phone rang about nine. The damn infernal phone. 


It was Jay Grayer. I couldn't imagine why he would be calling me at home. I almost 


didn't want to hear the reason for his call. 
"Alex, you have to come out to Lorton Prison," he said in an urgent-sounding voice. 
"Please come, right now." 


I BROKE every posted speed limit traveling out to the federal prison in Virginia. My 
head was spinning, threatening to come right off, to smash through the car windshield. 
As a homicide detective, you need to think that you're strong and that you can take just 
about anything that's dished out, but sooner or later you find out you really can't. Nobody 
can. 

I had been to Lorton Prison a few times before. The kidnapper and mass killer Gary 

Soneji had been kept in maximum security there once upon a time. 
I arrived about ten in the morning. It was a crisp, blue-skied morning. A few reporters 
were in the parking lot and on the side lawns when I arrived. 


"What do you know, Detective Cross?" one of them asked. 
"Beautiful morning," I said. "You can quote me. Feel free." 
This was where the Sterlings were being held in custody, where the government had 


decided to keep them until their trial for the murder of Thomas Byrnes. 
Alex, you have to come out to Lorton Prison. Please come, right now. 
I met Jay Grayer on the fourth floor of the prison building. 
Warden Marion Campbell was there, too. The two of them looked as pale as the 


institution's stucco walls. 


"Oh, goddamn, Alex," Dr. Campbell groaned when he saw me approaching. The two of 
us went back. I took his hand and shook it firmly. "Let's go upstairs," he said. 
More police and prison personnel were posted outside an examination room on the fifth 


floor. Grayer and I filed inside behind the warden and his closest aides. My heart was in 


my throat. 
We had to wear blue surgical masks and clear plastic gloves for the occasion. We were 
having trouble breathing, even without the masks. 


"Oh, goddammit," I muttered as we entered the room. 
Jeanne and Brett Sterling were dead. 


The two bodies were laid out on matching stainless steel tables. Both Sterlings were 
stripped naked. The overhead lighting was bright and harsh. The glare was 
overpowering. 

The whole scene was beyond my powers of comprehension, beyond anyone's. 

Jack and Jill were dead. 

Jack and Jill had been murdered inside a federal prison. 

"Goddamnit. Goddamn them," I said into my surgical mask. 

Brett Sterling was well-built and looked powerful even in death. I could imagine him as 
Sara Rosen's lover. I noticed that the bottoms of his feet were dirty Probably walking 
barefoot in his cell all night. Pacing? Waiting for someone to come for him? 

Who had gotten inside Lorton and done this? Was he murdered? 

What in the name of God had happened? How could it happen here? 

Jeanne Sterling had pasty-white skin, and she wasn't in good physical shape. She looked 
much better in tailored gray and blue suits than in the nude. 

Above her black pubic hair was a soft roll of paunch. Her legs were crisscrossed with 
varicose veins. She'd had a nosebleed either before she died or while she was dying. 

Neither of the Sterlings seemed to have suffered much. Was that a clue for us? They 
both had been found dead in their cells at the same 5:00 A.M. guard check. 

They had died close to the same time. According to plan? Of course, according to plan. 
But whose plan was it? 

Jack and Jill came to Lorton Prison... and what happened to them here? What the hell 
happened out here last night?... Who finally killed Jack and Jill? 

"They both underwent extensive body searches when they were brought here," Warden 
Campbell said to Jay and me. "This may have been a joint suicide, but they had to have 
help, even for that. Someone got them the poison between six last night and early this 
morning. Somebody got inside their cells." 

Dr. Marion Campbell looked directly at me. His eyes were bleary and wild and 
incredibly red-rimmed. "There was a small amount of skin and blood under her right 
index finger. She fought someone. Jeanne Sterling tried to fight back. She was 
murdered; at least, I think so. She didn't want to die, Alex." 


I closed my eyes for a second or two. It didn't help. Everything was the same when I 
opened them again. Jeanne and Brett Sterling still lay naked and dead on the two 
stainless steel tables. 

They had been executed. Professionally Without passion. 

That was the eeriest part -- it was almost as if Jack and Jill had been visited and murdered 
by Jack and Jill. 

Had a "ghost" murdered Jeanne and Brett Sterling? I was afraid we would never know. 
We weren't supposed to know. We weren't important enough to know the truth. 

Except maybe one tenet, one principle: there are no rules. 

Not for some people, anyway. 

I ALWAYS WANT everything tied up nice and neat with a bright ribbon and bow on the 
package. I want to be the mastermind dragonslayer on every case. It just doesn't work 
out that way -- probably wouldn't be any fun if it did. 

I spent the next two and a half days at the Sterling house, working side by side with the 
Secret Service and FBI. Jay Grayer and Kyle Craig both came out to the house in Chevy 
Chase. I had an idea in the back of my head that maybe Jeanne Sterling had left us a clue 
to go on -- something to get back at her murderers. 

Just in case. I figured that she was capable of something nasty and vengeful like that -- 
her last dirty trick! 

After two and a half days, we didn't find anything in the house. 

If there had been a clue, then someone had gotten into the house first. I didn't discount 
that possibility 

Kyle Craig and I talked out in the kitchen late the afternoon of the third day We were 
both pretty well worn to the bone. We opened a couple of Brett Sterling's microbrewery 
ales and had a chat about life, death, and infinity. 

"You ever hear of the notion -- too many logical suspects?" I asked Kyle as we sipped 
our beers in the quiet of the Sterling kitchen. 

"Not that specific language, but I can see how it applies here. 

We have scenarios that could implicate the CIA, the military, maybe big business, maybe 
even President Mahoney History rarely moves in straight lines." 


I nodded at Kyle's answer. As usual, he was a quick study "Thirty-five years after the 
Kennedy assassination the only thing that's certain is that there was some kind of 
conspiracy," I said to him. 

"No way to reconcile the physical evidence- ballistic and medical -- with one shooter in 
Dallas," Kyle said. 

"So there's the same goddamn problem -- too many logical suspects. To this day, nobody 
can rule out the possible involvement of Lyndon Johnson, the Army, a CIA 'black op,' the 
Mafia, your outfit's old boss. There are such obvious parallels to what's happened here, 
Kyle. A possible coup d'etat to eliminate a troublemaker in office -- with a much 
friendlier replacement -- LB J, and now Mahoney -- waiting in the wings. The CIA and 
the military were extremely angry at both JFK and Thomas Byrnes. The system fiercely 
resists change." 

"Keep that in mind, Alex," Kyle said to me. "The system fiercely resists change, and also 
troublemakers." 

I frowned, but nodded my head. "I have it in mind. Thanks for all your help." 

Kyle reached out his hand and we shook. "Too many logical suspects," I said. "Is that 
part of the nasty, badass plot, too? Is that their idea for cover in daylight? 

"It wouldn't surprise me if it was. Nothing surprises me anymore. 

I'm going home to see my kids," I finally said. 

"I can't think of anything better to do," Kyle said and smiled and waved for me to go on 
and get out of there. 

I CAME HOME and played with the kids -- tried to be there for them. I kept flashing on 
the face of Thomas Byrnes, though. 

Occasionally, I saw beautiful little Shanelle Green or Vernon Wheatley or even poor 
George Johnson, Christine's husband. I saw the corpses of Jeanne and Brett Sterling on 
those stainless steel gurneys at Lorton Prison. 

I worked some hours at the soup kitchen at St. As over the next few days. I'm "Mr. 
Peanut Butter Man" there. I ration out the PB&J, and occasionally a little pro bono 
advice for those more or less unfortunate than myself. I really enjoy the work. I get back 
even more than I give. 

I couldn't concentrate on much of anything, though. I was there, but I wasn't really there. 
The concept of no rules was stuck like a fish bone in my throat. I was choking on it. 
There really were too many suspects to chase down and ultimately solve the murder of 


Thomas Byrnes. And there were limitations to how much a D.C. cop could do on such a 

case. It over now, I tried to tell myself, except the parts you will always carry with you. 
One night that week -- late -- I was out on the sun porch. I was scratching Rosie the cat's 
back and she was purring sweetly. 

I was thinking about playing the piano, but I didn't do it. No Billie Smith, no Gershwin, 
no Oscar Peterson. The monsters, the furies, the demons were loose in my mind. They 
came in all shapes and sizes, all genders, but they were human monsters. 

This was Dante's Divine Comedy, all nine circles, and we were all living here together. 
Finally, I began to play my piano. I played "Star Dust" and then "Body and Soul," and I 


was soon lost in the glorious sounds. I didn't think about a call I'd had earlier in the 
week. I had been suspended from the D.C. police force. It was a disciplinary action. ! 
I had struck out at my superior, Chief George Pittman. 
Yes, I had. I was guilty as charged. So what? And now what? 
I heard a knock at the porch door. Then a second rap. 
I wasn't expecting company and didn't want any. I hoped it wasn't Sampson. It was too 


late for any visitors I needed to see that night. 


I grabbed my gun. Reflex action. Force of habit. Terrifying habit when you stop to 
think about it -- which I did. 
I rose from the piano bench and went to see who was there. 
After all the bad things that had happened, I almost expected to see the killer Gary Soneji, 


come to finally get even or at least, to try his luck. 
I opened the back door -- and I found myself smiling. No, I actually glowed. A light 


went on, or went back on, inside my head. What a nice surprise. I felt much, much better 
in an instant. 
It just happened that way. Pack up all my cares and woes. 
"I couldn't sleep," Christine Johnson said to me. I recognized the line I had used once at 


her house. 
I remembered Damon's line, She's even tougher than you are, Daddy. 
"Hello, Christine. How are you? God, I'm glad it's you," I whispered. 



"As opposed to?" she asked. 
"Everyone else," I said. 
I took Christine's hand in mine, and we went inside the house on Fifth Street. 
Home. 
Where there are still rules, and everybody is safe, and the dragonslayer is alive and well. 
IT REALLY DOESN'T END -- the cruel, relentless nightmare, the roller-coaster ride 


from hell. 
It was Christmas Eve and the stockings were hung from the chimney with care. Damon, 


Jannie, and I had almost finished decorating the tree -- the final touch being long strings 
of popcorn and shiny red cranberries. 
The damn telephone rang and I picked it up. Nat King Cole sang carols in the 

background. A fresh layer of snow glistened on the tiny patch of lawn outside. 
"Hello," I said. 
"Why hello. If it isn't Doctor/Detective Cross himself. What a neat treat." 
I didn't have to ask who the caller was -- I recognized the voice. The sound of it had been 


in my nightmares for a while -- years. 


"Long time, no talk," Gary Soneji said. "I've missed you, Doctor Cross. Have you missed 
me?" 
Gary Soneji had kidnapped two young children in Washington a few years back, then 

he'd led us on an incredible search that lasted for months. Of all the murderers I'd known, 
Soneji was the brightest. He had even fooled some of us into believing that he was a split 
personality He'd escaped from prison twice. 

"I've thought of you," I finally told him the truth, "often." 

"Well, I just called to wish you and yours a happy and holy holiday season. I've been 
born again, you see." 
I didn't say anything to Soneji. I waited. The kids had picked up that something was 


wrong about the phone call. They watched me, until I waved for them to finish up with 
the Christmas tree. 
"Oh, there's one other thing, Doctor Cross," Soneji whispered after a long pause. 



I knew there was something. "What is it, Gary? What's the one other thing?" 
"Are you enjoying her? I just had to ask. I have to know. Do you like her?" 
I held my breath. He knew about Christine, goddamn him! 
"You see, I was the one who left little Rosie the cat for your family Nice touch, don't you 


think? So whenever you see the little cutie, you just think- Gary in the house! Gary real 
close! I am, you know. Have a joyous and safe New Year. I'll be seeing you soon." 

Gary Soneji hung up the phone with a gentle click. 
And then so did I. I went back to the beautiful tree andJannie and Damon and Nat King 
Cole. 


Until next time. 
The End
